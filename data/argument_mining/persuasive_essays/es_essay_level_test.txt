International O
tourism O
is O
now O
more O
common O
than O
ever O
before O
The O
last O
50 O
years O
have O
seen O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
tourist O
traveling O
worldwide O
. O
While O
some O
might O
think O
the B-C
tourism I-C
bring I-C
large I-C
profit I-C
for I-C
the I-C
destination I-C
countries I-C
, O
I O
would O
contend O
that O
this B-M
industry I-M
has I-M
affected I-M
the I-M
cultural I-M
attributes I-M
and I-M
damaged I-M
the I-M
natural I-M
environment I-M
of I-M
the I-M
tourist I-M
destinations I-M
. O
Firstly O
, O
it O
is O
an O
undeniable O
fact O
that O
tourists B-P
from I-P
different I-P
cultures I-P
will I-P
probably I-P
cause I-P
changes I-P
to I-P
the I-P
cultural I-P
identity I-P
of I-P
the I-P
tourist I-P
destinations I-P
. O
Take B-P
Thailand I-P
for I-P
example I-P
, I-P
in I-P
the I-P
Vietnam I-P
War I-P
, I-P
many I-P
American I-P
soldiers I-P
came I-P
to I-P
Thailand I-P
for I-P
a I-P
break I-P
and I-P
involved I-P
in I-P
sexual I-P
and I-P
drug I-P
activities I-P
, I-P
these I-P
huge I-P
demands I-P
caused I-P
many I-P
local I-P
businesses I-P
opened I-P
and I-P
expanded I-P
, I-P
even I-P
illegally I-P
involved I-P
in I-P
under I-P
- I-P
age I-P
prostitutes I-P
to I-P
maximize I-P
their I-P
profits I-P
. O
This B-P
was I-P
due I-P
to I-P
the I-P
lack I-P
of I-P
adequate I-P
controls I-P
by I-P
authorities I-P
and I-P
lead I-P
to I-P
a I-P
bad I-P
image I-P
of I-P
Thailand I-P
tourism I-P
. O
Therefore O
this O
proves O
that O
international B-C
tourism I-C
can I-C
create I-C
negative I-C
impacts I-C
on I-C
the I-C
destination I-C
countries I-C
. O
Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
clear O
evidences O
that O
tourism B-P
increasingly I-P
create I-P
harms I-P
to I-P
the I-P
natural I-P
habitats I-P
of I-P
the I-P
destination I-P
appeals I-P
. O
As B-P
the I-P
Australia I-P
’ I-P
s I-P
Great I-P
Barrier I-P
Reef I-P
has I-P
shown I-P
, I-P
the I-P
billion I-P
visitors I-P
per I-P
annum I-P
has I-P
generated I-P
immense I-P
destruction I-P
to I-P
this I-P
nature I-P
wonder I-P
, I-P
namely I-P
breaking I-P
the I-P
corals I-P
caused I-P
by I-P
walking I-P
or I-P
throwing I-P
boat I-P
’ I-P
s I-P
anchors I-P
, I-P
dropping I-P
fuel I-P
and I-P
other I-P
sorts I-P
of I-P
pollutions I-P
. O
For O
this O
reason O
, O
many B-P
marine I-P
lives I-P
have I-P
been I-P
endangered I-P
, I-P
in I-P
the I-P
extremes I-P
part I-P
of I-P
the I-P
reef I-P
become I-P
uninhabitable I-P
for I-P
these I-P
marine I-P
species I-P
. O
Thus O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
tourism B-C
has I-C
threatened I-C
the I-C
nature I-C
environments I-C
. O
To O
conclude O
, O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the B-M
tourism I-M
has I-M
created I-M
threatening I-M
pressure I-M
on I-M
both I-M
the I-M
sociocultural I-M
and I-M
natural I-M
environments I-M
. O
If O
authorities O
do O
not O
take O
steps O
to O
appropriately O
conserve O
these O
precious O
values O
, O
they O
will O
be O
destroyed O
in O
the O
near O
future O

Living O

It O

every O

desire O
to O

of O
the O

of O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
one B-M
who I-M
studies I-M
overseas I-M
will I-M
gain I-M
many I-M
skills I-M
throughout I-M
this I-M
experience I-M
for O
several O
reasons O
. O
First O
, O
studying B-C
at I-C
an I-C
overseas I-C
university I-C
gives I-C
individuals I-C
the I-C
opportunity I-C
to I-C

social I-C

Compared B-P
to I-P
the I-P
peers I-P
studying I-P

the I-P
home I-P
country I-P
, I-P
it I-P
will I-P
be I-P
more I-P
likely I-P
for I-P
the I-P
one I-P
who I-P
is I-P
living I-P
overseas I-P
to I-P
be I-P
successful I-P
in I-P
adapting I-P
himself I-P
/ I-P
herself I-P
into I-P
new I-P
environments I-P
and I-P
situations I-P
in I-P
life I-P
. O
Second O
, O
living B-C
and I-C
studying I-C
overseas I-C
is I-C
an I-C
irreplaceable I-C
experience I-C
when I-C
it I-C
comes I-C
to I-C
learn I-C
standing I-C
on I-C
your I-C
own I-C
feet I-C
. O
One B-P
who I-P
is I-P
living I-P
overseas I-P
will I-P
of I-P
course I-P
struggle I-P
with I-P
loneliness I-P
, I-P
living I-P
away I-P
from I-P
family I-P
and I-P
friends I-P
but O
those B-P
difficulties I-P
will I-P
turn I-P
into I-P
valuable I-P
experiences I-P
in I-P
the I-P
following I-P
steps I-P
of I-P
life I-P
. O
Moreover O
, O
the B-P
one I-P
will I-P
learn I-P
living I-P
without I-P
depending I-P
on I-P
anyone I-P
else I-P
. O
Also O
, O
employers B-P
are I-P
mostly I-P
looking I-P
for I-P
people I-P
who I-P
have I-P
international I-P
and I-P
language I-P
skills I-P
. O
Becoming B-P
successful I-P
in I-P
this I-P
study I-P
will I-P
give I-P
the I-P
student I-P
an I-P
edge I-P
in I-P
job I-P
market I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
one B-C
who I-C
has I-C
studied I-C
and I-C
lived I-C
overseas I-C
will I-C
become I-C
more I-C
eligible I-C
for I-C
the I-C
job I-C
than I-C
his I-C
/ I-C
her I-C
peers I-C
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
there B-C
are I-C
many I-C
difficulties I-C
a I-C
student I-C
might I-C
face I-C
when I-C
studying I-C
and I-C
living I-C
overseas I-C
. O
However O
, O
living B-M

studying I-M
overseas I-M
gives I-M
the I-M
individual I-M
a I-M

perspective I-M

publicizing B-C

the B-C

Advertising O
- O
positive O
or O

part O
of O
our O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
use O
of O
advertisement O
through O
different O
forms O
of O
media O
such O
as O
newspapers O
, O
radio O
and O
television O
has O
become O
very O
prevalent O
, O
so O
it O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
today O
' O
s O
society O
. O
Many O
believe O
that O
advertising O
has O
brought O
great O
benefits O
to O
lives O
therefore O
it O
should O
be O
considered O
a O
positive O
activity O
while O
others O
have O
held O
a O
complete O
different O
idea O
about O
this O
. O
Both O
views O
will O
be O
critiqued O
before O
a O
reasonable O
conclusion O
is O
drawn O
. O
First O
, O
it O
is O
generally O
understood O
that O
advertising B-P
is I-P
carried I-P
out I-P
with I-P
the I-P
main I-P
purpose I-P
of I-P
promoting I-P
different I-P
products I-P
and I-P
services I-P
or I-P
encouraging I-P
people I-P
to I-P
consume I-P
more I-P
. O
Advertisements B-C
are I-C
, I-C
therefore I-C
, I-C
very I-C
important I-C
for I-C
many I-C
businesses I-C
to I-C
increase I-C
sales I-C
and I-C
hence I-C
profits I-C
. O
Also O
, O
to B-C
consumers I-C
, I-C
advertising I-C
can I-C
bring I-C
them I-C
many I-C
benefits I-C
. O
For O
example O
, O
customers B-P
of I-P
telecommunication I-P
services I-P
will I-P
have I-P
an I-P
idea I-P
about I-P
the I-P
current I-P
offers I-P
of I-P
different I-P
companies I-P
and O
hence O
they B-P
can I-P
compare I-P
them I-P
and I-P
then I-P
have I-P
a I-P
better I-P
decision I-P
in I-P
choosing I-P
their I-P
internet I-P
or I-P
mobile I-P
phone I-P
plans I-P
. O
From O
all O
of O
these O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
see O
why O
the O
idea O
that O
advertising O
is O
a O
positive O
part O
of O
life O
will O
garner O
strong O
support O
. O
However O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
some O
people O
have O
argued O
against O
advertising O
due O
to O
its O
negative O
impacts O
. O
Firstly O
, O
a B-C
huge I-C
amount I-C
of I-C
different I-C
advertisements I-C
could I-C
be I-C
sent I-C
automatically I-C
by I-C
a I-C
system I-C
to I-C
personal I-C
phones I-C
or I-C
email I-C
addresses I-C
, I-C
this I-C
is I-C
generally I-C
known I-C
as I-C
spam I-C
, I-C
and I-C
causes I-C
discomfort I-C
or I-C
even I-C
annoyance I-C
to I-C
many I-C
people I-C
. O
Secondly O
, O
advertising B-P
can I-P
be I-P
very I-P
expensive I-P
and I-P
not I-P
every I-P
advertising I-P
campaign I-P
can I-P
be I-P
done I-P
successfully I-P
and I-P
brings I-P
good I-P
results I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
advertising B-C
is I-C
believed I-C
by I-C
many I-C
, I-C
a I-C
financial I-C
burden I-C
to I-C
businesses I-C
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
after O
analyzing O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
of O
advertising O
, O
both O
of O
the O
views O
have O
strong O
support O
, O
but O
it O
is O
felt O
that O
more B-C
good I-C
comes I-C
from I-C
advertising I-C
than I-C
bad I-C
. O
Thus O
, O
the B-M
idea I-M
that I-M
advertising I-M
is I-M
a I-M
positive I-M
part I-M
of I-M
life I-M
can I-M
be I-M
more I-M
supported I-M

up I-M
children I-M

To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
undeniable O
that O

is I-P
better I-P
in I-P

the I-P

todays I-P

one I-P
of I-P
the I-P
most I-P
important I-P
parts I-P
of I-P
our I-P
children I-P
' I-P

life I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
it B-C
is I-C
a I-C
good I-C
idea I-C
for I-C
children I-C
to I-C
past I-C
their I-C
first I-C
earlier I-C
life I-C
in I-C
the I-C

What O
is O
more O
, O
it B-P
is I-P
acknowledged I-P
that I-P
a I-P
large I-P
number I-P
of I-P
creational I-P
facilities I-P
are I-P
built I-P

Children B-C
who I-C
live I-C
in I-C

have I-C
a I-C

in B-P

Children B-P
who I-P

most I-P
of I-P
the I-P
time I-P

their I-P

Finally O
, O
in B-P
big I-P
cities I-P
children I-P
access I-P

so O
they B-C

the I-P
other I-P

they I-C

It O

if O

they I-P

more I-P
efficiently I-P

deeply I-P
on I-P

which I-P

In O

without B-P
the I-P

a B-C

some I-C

erode I-C
the I-C
cultural I-C
identity I-C
of I-C
a I-C
nation I-C

This O
is O
because O
people B-P
may I-P
be I-P
impressed I-P
by I-P
the I-P
cultural I-P

brought I-P

the I-P
universal I-P

eroding I-P
a I-P
sense I-P
of I-P

. O
For O
instance O
, O
some B-P
Asians I-P
are I-P
seeking I-P
individualism I-P
, I-P
previously I-P
denied I-P
by I-P
many I-P
Asian I-P
countries I-P
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they B-P
have I-P
gradually I-P
identified I-P
with I-P
such I-P
values I-P
expressed I-P
in I-P
American I-P

are I-P
imported I-P

a I-P
result I-P
of I-P
the I-P

. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
would O
conclude O
that O
a B-M

On O
the O

every B-C

should I-C
by I-C
no I-C

Whenever O

a O
common O

popular B-M
sports I-M

countries I-C

Because O
a B-P

people I-P
will I-P
gather I-P
in I-P
the I-P
host I-P

, O
there B-P
are I-P
many I-P

with I-C
the I-C

After B-P

the I-P

often I-P
shake I-P

lead I-P

an I-P

in I-P
the I-P

among I-P

Secondly O
, O
sporting B-P
occasions I-P
play I-P
an I-P
essential I-P
role I-P
in I-P
raising I-P
patriotic I-P
emotions I-P
in I-P
both I-P
athletes I-P

spectators I-P

Seeing B-P
national I-P

be I-P
honored I-P
may I-P
be I-P
the I-P
most I-P
emotional I-P
moments I-P
to I-P
each I-P

The B-P
athlete I-P
also I-P
seems I-P
to I-P
be I-P
more I-P
aware I-P
of I-P
his I-P

he I-P
wants I-P
to I-P
contribute I-P
more I-P
to I-P
his I-P

When B-P
witnessing I-P
our I-P
national I-P

many I-P
of I-P

For O

when B-P

for I-P
the I-P
first I-P

a I-P

permeated I-P

People B-P
from I-P
all I-P

turned I-P
out I-P

The B-P
eager I-P
atmosphere I-P
lasted I-P
many I-P
next I-P
days I-P

In O
fact O
, O
some B-P
hooligans I-P
were I-P
so I-P
excited I-P
that I-P
they I-P
took I-P
part I-P
in I-P
motor I-P
racing I-P
or I-P
using I-P
fireworks I-P
illegally I-P

However O
, O
the B-P
hooligans I-P
only I-P
took I-P
a I-P
minority I-P
of I-P
people I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
sport B-C

help I-C

wake I-C
up I-C
love I-C

responsibilities I-C
strongly I-C
in I-C
each I-C
citizen I-C

In O
conclusion O
, O
international B-M

are I-M
not I-M
only I-M
one I-M
of I-M
the I-M
effective I-M
solutions I-M
to I-M

also I-M
a I-M

for I-M

safely I-M

Children O
engagement O

In O
many O
countries O
, O
children O
are O
educated O
from O
their O
young O
age O
to O
be O
independent O
and O
responsible O
for O
their O
actions O
. O
Their O
parents O
allow O
them O
to O
take O
some O
jobs O
because O
these O
jobs O
can O
help O
them O
learn O
and O
take O
responsibilities O
. O
However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
it O
' O
s O
not O
a O
good O
educational O
measure O
. O
From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the B-M
benefits I-M
of I-M
children I-M
engagement I-M
in I-M
paid I-M
work I-M
outweigh I-M
its I-M
drawbacks I-M
. O
First O
of O
all O
, O
children B-P
can I-P
learn I-P
about I-P
the I-P
hardship I-P
of I-P
earning I-P
money I-P
. O
When B-P
they I-P
take I-P
some I-P
kind I-P
of I-P
paid I-P
work I-P
such I-P
as I-P
looking I-P
after I-P
babies I-P
, I-P
doing I-P
housework I-P
and I-P
keeping I-P
shops I-P
, I-P
they I-P
will I-P
have I-P
some I-P
life I-P
experience I-P
and I-P
skills I-P
which I-P
make I-P
them I-P
mature I-P
and I-P
can I-P
deal I-P
with I-P
many I-P
different I-P
situations I-P
in I-P
real I-P
life I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
they B-C
are I-C
likely I-C
to I-C
understand I-C
their I-C
parents I-C
' I-C
hardship I-C
, I-C
to I-C
respect I-C
values I-C

money I-C
and I-C
to I-C
form I-C
a I-C
good I-C
habit I-C
of I-C

Secondly O
, O
when B-C
children I-C
take I-C
jobs I-C
, I-C
they I-C
tend I-C
to I-C
be I-C
more I-C
responsible I-C
because O
whether B-P
they I-P
can I-P
earn I-P
money I-P
or I-P
not I-P
will I-P
depend I-P
on I-P
their I-P
effectiveness I-P
and I-P
attitudes I-P
in I-P
working I-P
. O
To B-P
keep I-P
their I-P
jobs I-P
, I-P
children I-P
will I-P
have I-P
to I-P
try I-P
their I-P
best I-P
to I-P
finish I-P
their I-P
duties I-P

For O
example O
, O
if B-P
a I-P
child I-P
works I-P
as I-P
a I-P
shop I-P
assistant I-P
, I-P
he I-P
will I-P
have I-P
to I-P
keep I-P
an I-P
eye I-P
on I-P
good I-P
and I-P
products I-P
, I-P
calculate I-P
prices I-P
correctly I-P
and I-P
take I-P
responsibilities I-P
for I-P
any I-P
lost I-P
. O
Some O
people O
may O
argue O
that O
children B-C
will I-C
be I-C
more I-C
material I-C
, I-C
neglect I-C
their I-C
study I-C
for I-C
earning I-C
money I-C
or I-C
be I-C
exploited I-C
by I-C
the I-C
employers I-C
. O
However O
, O
if B-P
children I-P
get I-P
good I-P
care I-P
and I-P
instructions I-P
from I-P
their I-P
parents I-P
, I-P
they I-P
can I-P
take I-P
advantages I-P
of I-P
the I-P
work I-P
to I-P
learn I-P
valuable I-P
things I-P
and I-P
avoid I-P
going I-P
in I-P
a I-P
wrong I-P
way I-P
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
if B-M
children I-M
take I-M
part I-M
in I-M
some I-M
kind I-M
of I-M
paid I-M
work I-M
with I-M
their I-M
parents I-M

they I-M
can I-M
learn I-M
lively I-M
lessons I-M
and I-M
become I-M
mature I-M

responsible I-M
. O
I O
recommend O
that O

should O
help O
their O
children O
to O
choose O
a O
suitable O
job O
which O
does O
not O
affect O
their O

build I-P
an I-P

picture I-P

in B-C

the I-C

come I-C
up I-C

an I-C
objective I-C
decision I-C
not I-C
depending I-C
on I-C
the I-C
past I-C
experience I-C

the I-C

For O

, O
a B-P

more I-P
chance I-P

Innocent B-P

In O
conclusion O

I B-C

disregard I-P
the I-P

. O
From B-P
social I-P
perspective I-P
, I-P
massively I-P

one I-P

For O

sufficient B-P
pension I-P

they I-P

the B-C

Living O

There O
is O
a O
hotly O
debated O
issue O
over O
whether O
people O
have O
to O
live O
at O
a O
higher O
or O
lower O
pace O
, O
and O
this O
topic O
can O
also O
be O
approached O
from O
several O
different O
angles O
due O
to O
its O
complexity O

Some O
people O
tend O

be O

to O
complete O
their O
tasks O
, O
while O

to O
prefer O
the O

After O

, O
I B-M

to I-M
live I-M
in I-M
a I-M
higher I-M
pace I-M
condition I-M
. O
The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
we B-P
need I-P
to I-P
save I-P
time I-P
for I-P
accomplishing I-P
some I-P
important I-P
tasks I-P
, I-P
and I-P
a I-P
fitting I-P
example I-P
of I-P
which I-P
can I-P
be I-P
found I-P
in I-P
my I-P
experience I-P
of I-P
missing I-P
exam I-P
. O
I B-P
just I-P
failed I-P
to I-P
participate I-P
in I-P
the I-P
university I-P
entrance I-P
exam I-P
because O
I B-P
thought I-P
I I-P
had I-P
enough I-P
time I-P
for I-P
eating I-P
breakfast I-P
and I-P
transporting I-P
to I-P
the I-P
testing I-P
place I-P
; I-P
while I-P
I I-P
was I-P
stocked I-P
in I-P
a I-P
traffic I-P
jam I-P
and I-P
then I-P
missed I-P
the I-P
first I-P
test I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
start O
to O
agree O
that O
we B-C
have I-C
to I-C
be I-C
eager I-C
in I-C
our I-C
lives I-C
. O
Apart O
from O
the O
one O
I O
have O
mentioned O
above O
, O
another O
equally O
important O
aspect O
is O
keeping B-P
in I-P
high I-P
pace I-P
condition I-P
can I-P
prevent I-P
me I-P
from I-P
getting I-P
lazy I-P
. O
If B-P
I I-P
can I-P
avoid I-P
being I-P
a I-P
sluggish I-P
person I-P
, I-P
I I-P
can I-P
have I-P
a I-P
higher I-P
probability I-P
of I-P
fulfilling I-P
my I-P
dream I-P
successfully I-P
. O
For O
instance O
, O
I B-P
had I-P
spent I-P
more I-P
time I-P
on I-P
practicing I-P
playing I-P
piano I-P
so I-P
that I-P
I I-P
won I-P
a I-P
piano I-P
competition I-P
, I-P
defeating I-P
those I-P
spending I-P
less I-P
time I-P
on I-P
practicing I-P
. O
Hence O
, O
from O
this O
case O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
stating O
that O
keeping B-C
our I-C
pace I-C
higher I-C
is I-C
important I-C
. O
Admittedly O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
people O
proclaiming O
that O
with B-C
a I-C
slower I-C
pace I-C
can I-C
enjoy I-C
their I-C
lives I-C
more I-C
because O
it B-P
is I-P
not I-P
necessary I-P
for I-P
them I-P
to I-P
notice I-P
the I-P
time I-P

the I-P

However O

from O
my O

I O
just O

the O

I B-P

In O

it B-P

I O

some O

we B-M

give I-M
priority I-M

our I-M

issues I-M
. O
Animal O
protectionists O
may O
base O
their O

the O
ground O
that O
biodiversity B-P
is I-P
essential I-P
to I-P
maintain I-P
the I-P
balance I-P
of I-P

If B-P
certain I-P
species I-P

absent I-P

this I-P

such I-P
kind I-P

other I-P

human I-P

will I-P

, O
it B-C

our I-C

many I-C
species I-C
on I-C
the I-C
Earth I-C
as I-C

However O

I O
think O
species B-C

quite I-C
natural I-C

the I-C
theory I-C
of I-C
evolution I-C

The B-P

A B-P
great I-P
number I-P

animals I-P
died I-P

because O
they B-P
were I-P
unable I-P
to I-P

the I-P

. O
On O
most O
occasions O
, O
the B-P
process I-P
of I-P
extinction I-P
of I-P
some I-P
species I-P
is I-P
irrevocable I-P
and I-P
we I-P
can I-P
do I-P
nothing I-P
about I-P
it I-P
. O
Furthermore O
, O
human B-P
beings I-P
nowadays I-P
are I-P
still I-P
faced I-P

many I-P
urgent I-P
problems I-P
such I-P

starvation I-P

disease I-P
and I-P
wars I-P
. O
When B-P
these I-P
problems I-P
are I-P
taken I-P
into I-P
account I-P
, I-P
extinction I-P
of I-P
some I-P
animals I-P
recedes I-P
greatly I-P
in I-P
importance I-P
and I-P
it I-P
is I-P
not I-P
sensible I-P
to I-P
devote I-P
our I-P
limited I-P
resources I-P
to I-P
animals I-P
that I-P

We B-C

our I-C

It O
seems O
that O
one B-M
can I-M

more I-M
easily I-M
with I-M
the I-M
help I-M
from I-M
his I-M

her I-M

. O
I O
agree O
with O
this O
statement O
. O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
family B-M
plays I-M
a I-M
more I-M
important I-M
role I-M
in I-M
helping I-M
one I-M
to I-M
pursuit I-M
success I-M
. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O
First O
of O
all O
, O
more B-P
and I-P
more I-P
people I-P
have I-P
the I-P
opportunity I-P
to I-P
receive I-P
education I-P
from I-P
university I-P
. O
Since O
our B-P
parents I-P
receive I-P
better I-P
education I-P
than I-P
our I-P
grandparents I-P
did I-P
, O
they B-C
can I-C
provide I-C
more I-C
advices I-C
and I-C
helps I-C
in I-C
our I-C
career I-C
. O
In B-P
the I-P
past I-P
, I-P
seldom I-P
people I-P
have I-P
the I-P
chance I-P
to I-P
attend I-P
a I-P
collage I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
my B-P
grandparents I-P
did I-P
not I-P
get I-P
a I-P
education I-P
even I-P
in I-P
high I-P
school I-P
, O
so O
when B-P
my I-P
father I-P
had I-P
difficulty I-P
in I-P
solving I-P
a I-P
problem I-P
in I-P
his I-P
childhood I-P

he I-P
had I-P
to I-P
go I-P
to I-P
his I-P
teacher I-P
for I-P
help I-P
. O
Things B-P
have I-P
changed I-P
a I-P
lot I-P

I B-P
grow I-P
up I-P
in I-P
a I-P
better I-P
condition I-P
than I-P
my I-P
father I-P
did I-P
. O
Whenever B-P
I I-P
have I-P
problems I-P
, I-P
I I-P
can I-P
always I-P
ask I-P
my I-P
parents I-P
for I-P
help I-P
. O
They B-P
can I-P
solve I-P
the I-P
problem I-P
quickly I-P

they B-P
have I-P
learned I-P
quite I-P
a I-P
lot I-P
. O
What O
is O
more O
, O
family B-C
members I-C
can I-C
help I-C
us I-C
in I-C
many I-C
other I-C
aspects I-C
. O
For O
example O
, O
when B-P
I I-P
did I-P
not I-P
know I-P
what I-P
major I-P
to I-P
choose I-P
when I-P
I I-P
attend I-P
university I-P
, I-P
my I-P
father I-P
told I-P
a I-P
lot I-P
about I-P
different I-P
majors I-P
. O
He B-P
shared I-P
his I-P
own I-P
experience I-P
with I-P
me I-P
, I-P
which I-P
helped I-P
me I-P
quite I-P
a I-P
lot I-P
. O
Parents B-P
are I-P
quite I-P
experienced I-P
than I-P
their I-P
child I-P
, O
they B-P
can I-P
guide I-P
them I-P
toward I-P
the I-P
right I-P
direction I-P
. O
Besides O
, O
parents B-P
can I-P
told I-P
their I-P
children I-P
as I-P
many I-P
as I-P
they I-P
can I-P
. O
What B-P
they I-P
want I-P
is I-P
help I-P
their I-P
child I-P
to I-P
make I-P
a I-P
progress I-P
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
our B-C
parents I-C
and I-C
other I-C
family I-C
members I-C
can I-C
help I-C
us I-C
a I-C
lot I-C
in I-C
our I-C
life I-C
. O
I O
believe O
that O
with B-M
the I-M

Some O
people O
believe O
that O
there O
should O

Generally O
reason O
behind O
punishment O
is O
to O
reduce O

think O
that O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
what O
is O
reason O
behind O
committing O
a O
crime O
therefore O
there O
should O
be O
fixed O
punishment O
for O
a O
specific O
crime O
. O
Alternatively O
I O
believe O
that O
it B-M
should I-M
taken I-M

consideration I-M
the I-M
situation I-M

conditions I-M

that I-M

criminal I-M

First O
of O
all O
if B-C
there I-C
will I-C
be I-C
a I-C
fixed I-C
punishment I-C
for I-C
each I-C
type I-C
of I-C
crime I-C
then I-C
it I-C
will I-C
lead I-C
to I-C
increase I-C
the I-C
crime I-C
because O
the B-P
punishment I-P
will I-P
be I-P
clear I-P
in I-P
the I-P
mind I-P
of I-P
professional I-P
criminals I-P
and I-P
they I-P
will I-P
not I-P
feel I-P
fear I-P
while I-P
committing I-P
a I-P
crime I-P
. O
Secondly O
, O
laws B-P
and I-P
rules I-P
are I-P
there I-P
for I-P
people I-P
therefore O
it B-C
is I-C
necessary I-C
to I-C
have I-C
a I-C
look I-C
behind I-C
crime I-C
for O
instance O
" O
a B-P
women I-P
steals I-P
feed I-P
for I-P
her I-P
child I-P
should I-P
be I-P
treated I-P
same I-P
as I-P
a I-P
women I-P
, I-P
who I-P
steals I-P
for I-P
her I-P
drug I-P
addiction I-P
" O
. O
The B-P
person I-P
who I-P
committed I-P
crime I-P
first I-P
time I-P
and I-P
the I-P
professional I-P
criminals I-P
should I-P
not I-P
be I-P
imprisoned I-P
at I-P
same I-P
place I-P
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
fixed B-C
punishment I-C
will I-C
reduce I-C
the I-C
time I-C
taken I-C
by I-C
judges I-C
to I-C
give I-C
their I-C
judgement I-C
and I-C
it I-C
will I-C
be I-C
effective I-C
economically I-C
for I-C
the I-C
Government I-C
. O
Everyone B-P
should I-P
be I-P
treated I-P
equally I-P
because O
sometimes B-P
we I-P
see I-P
that I-P
a I-P
poor I-P
person I-P
who I-P
do I-P
not I-P
have I-P
much I-P
money I-P
for I-P
hiring I-P
a I-P
good I-P
lawyer I-P
they I-P
get I-P
imprisoned I-P
even I-P
without I-P
committing I-P
a I-P
crime I-P
and I-P
when I-P
they I-P
come I-P
back I-P
to I-P
the I-P
society I-P
they I-P
become I-P
a I-P
professional I-P
criminal I-P
. O
Therefore O
fixed B-C
punishment I-C
will I-C
reduce I-C
the I-C
space I-C
between I-C
poor I-C
and I-C
rich I-C
people I-C
and I-C
everyone I-C
will I-C
understand I-C
the I-C
importance I-C

each I-C

To O
conclude O

Government B-M
should I-M
decide I-M
for I-M
punishment I-M
case I-M

In O
doing O

also I-C
another I-C

the I-C

The O
precondition O
of O
doing O
research O
by O
professors O
Nowadays O
, O
many O
professors O
conduct O
research O
while O
teaching O
in O
colleges O
or O
universities O
. O
Although O
research B-P
could I-P
bring I-P
funding I-P
and I-P
latest I-P
achievements I-P
in I-P
the I-P
field I-P
, O
the B-C
research I-C
takes I-C
up I-C
too I-C
much I-C
teaching I-C
time I-C
. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
, O
professors B-M
should I-M
spend I-M
more I-M
time I-M
on I-M
preparing I-M
courses I-M
than I-M
research I-M
. O
To O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
is O
vital O
that O
professors B-P
should I-P
assist I-P
students I-P
to I-P
acquire I-P
knowledge I-P
. O
The B-P
professors I-P
’ I-P
duty I-P
is I-P
to I-P
nurture I-P
students I-P
, I-P
and I-P
prepare I-P
excellent I-P
courses I-P
. O
If B-P
professors I-P
spend I-P
a I-P
lot I-P
of I-P
time I-P
on I-P
research I-P
, I-P
he I-P
will I-P
cut I-P
the I-P
time I-P
on I-P
preparing I-P
courses I-P
is I-P
reduced I-P
, I-P
which I-P
may I-P
decrease I-P
the I-P
quality I-P
of I-P
classes I-P
. O
The B-P
reason I-P
why I-P
people I-P
enter I-P
a I-P
university I-P
is I-P
that I-P
they I-P
want I-P
to I-P
learn I-P
cutting I-P
- I-P
edged I-P
technologies I-P
. O
In O
this O
way O
, O
professors B-P
should I-P
provide I-P
well I-P
- I-P
preparation I-P
courses I-P
to I-P
convey I-P
the I-P
state I-P
- I-P
of I-P
- I-P
art I-P
knowledge I-P
for I-P
college I-P
and I-P
university I-P
students I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
professors B-C
should I-C
pay I-C
more I-C
attention I-C
on I-C
how I-C
to I-C
teach I-C
students I-C
rather I-C
than I-C
conduct I-C
research I-C
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if B-P
professors I-P
are I-P
busy I-P
in I-P
doing I-P
research I-P
, I-P
ignoring I-P
preparing I-P
appropriate I-P
courses I-P
for I-P
students I-P
, I-P
it I-P
would I-P
ruin I-P
the I-P
reputation I-P
of I-P
universities I-P
. O
Students B-P
are I-P
unsatisfied I-P
with I-P
the I-P
unprepared I-P
course I-P
, I-P
and I-P
the I-P
enrollment I-P
of I-P
universities I-P
may I-P
decline I-P
. O
Many B-P
students I-P
would I-P
not I-P
choose I-P
these I-P
kinds I-P
of I-P
universities I-P
to I-P
study I-P
. O
In O
this O
way O
, O
hardly B-P
can I-P
professors I-P
find I-P
assistants I-P
to I-P
help I-P
with I-P
projects I-P
. O
It B-P
is I-P
adverse I-P
to I-P
the I-P
whole I-P
academic I-P
field I-P
. O
Accordingly O
, O
spending B-C
more I-C
time I-C
to I-C
nurture I-C
excellent I-C
students I-C
is I-C
more I-C
consequential I-C
to I-C
professors I-C
, I-C
rather I-C
than I-C
research I-C
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
professors B-C
could I-C
teach I-C
students I-C
through I-C
research I-C
and I-C
projects I-C
. O
Some B-P
students I-P
enjoy I-P
taking I-P
part I-P
in I-P
some I-P
research I-P
. O
Through B-P
to I-P
use I-P
the I-P
equipment I-P
and I-P
invent I-P
their I-P
own I-P
work I-P
, I-P
they I-P
may I-P
get I-P
more I-P
experience I-P
in I-P
the I-P
process I-P
of I-P
research I-P
. O
For O
instance O
, O
electronic B-P
students I-P
always I-P
invent I-P
new I-P
machines I-P
such I-P
as I-P
robots I-P

MP3 I-P

control I-P

They B-P
can I-P
manage I-P
the I-P
electric I-P
theory I-P
in I-P
practical I-P
skills I-P
. O
And B-P
some I-P
students I-P
will I-P
be I-P
rewarded I-P
by I-P
investing I-P
new I-P
inventions I-P
. O
However O
, O
only B-P
under I-P
specific I-P
circumstance I-P
, I-P
when I-P
students I-P
master I-P
all I-P
of I-P
the I-P
systematic I-P
knowledge I-P
, I-P
can I-P
they I-P
accomplish I-P
research I-P
. O
This B-P
is I-P
requires I-P
professors I-P
provide I-P
high I-P
quality I-P
courses I-P
. O
In O
other O
word O
, O
professor B-C
should I-C
concern I-C
about I-C
preparing I-C
class I-C
. O
Consequently O
, O
conducting B-P
research I-P
is I-P
helpful I-P
for I-P
professors I-P
and I-P
students I-P
to I-P
some I-P
extent I-P
. O
However O
, O
the B-P

Only B-C

can I-C
we I-C
have I-C
a I-C

Professors B-M

Apartments O

Many O

an O

, O
an B-C
apartment I-C

a I-C
lot I-C
more I-C
freedom I-C
than I-C
a I-C
dormitory I-C
. O
While B-P
in I-P
a I-P
dormitory I-P
you I-P
have I-P
to I-P
obey I-P
preset I-P
rules I-P
, I-P
in I-P
the I-P
apartment I-P
you I-P
set I-P
your I-P
own I-P
rules I-P
. O
You B-P
are I-P
free I-P
to I-P
have I-P
visits I-P
at I-P
any I-P
time I-P
or I-P
to I-P
be I-P
left I-P
alone I-P
if I-P
you I-P
want I-P
. O
An B-P
apartment I-P
offers I-P
more I-P
privacy I-P
because O
you B-P
can I-P
choose I-P
to I-P
have I-P
your I-P
own I-P
room I-P
instead I-P
of I-P
sharing I-P
with I-P
another I-P
student I-P
. O
This O
is O
an O
important O
factor O
because O
you B-P

more I-P

Second O
, O
from O

point O

people O
often O

that O
an B-C
apartment I-C
is I-C
more I-C
expensive I-C
. O
This O
is O
only O
partially O
true O
, O
you B-P

rent I-P
the I-P
extra I-P
rooms I-P
in I-P
the I-P
apartment I-P
to I-P
other I-P
people I-P
and I-P
rent I-P
would I-P
be I-P
a I-P
lot I-P
cheaper I-P

Transportation B-P
is I-P
another I-P
issue I-P
, I-P
you I-P
have I-P
to I-P
go I-P

return I-P

the I-P
university I-P
everyday I-P

You B-P

choose I-P

use I-P
public I-P
transportation I-P

a I-P
cheaper I-P
option I-P
, I-P
or I-P
to I-P
have I-P
a I-P
car I-P
. O
The B-P
car I-P
is I-P
an I-P
expensive I-P
option I-P
, I-P
but I-P
also I-P
offers I-P
freedom I-P
of I-P
schedule I-P
and I-P
destination I-P
. O
Lastly O
, O
the B-C
studying I-C
conditions I-C
are I-C
better I-C
in I-C
an I-C
apartment I-C
because O
you B-P
don I-P
' I-P

have I-P
all I-P
the I-P
noise I-P

distractions I-P
that I-P
you I-P
often I-P
have I-P
in I-P
dormitories I-P

A B-P
lot I-P
of I-P
students I-P
often I-P
complain I-P
about I-P
their I-P
roommate I-P

this I-P

you B-P

the O

In O
the O

a I-P
dormitory I-P

Why O
are O
groups O
or O
organizations O
important O
to O
people O
? O
During O
our O
life O
, O
it O
is O
inevitable O
that O
we O
may O
be O
related O
with O
any O
groups O
or O
organizations O
; O
therefore O
, O
groups O
and O
organizations O
are O
an O
important O
part O
of O
their O
lives O
. O
In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
groups B-M
provide I-M
a I-M
place I-M
for I-M
people I-M
to I-M
gain I-M
experiences I-M
or I-M
achieve I-M
goals I-M
. O
My O
reasons O
include O
the O
following O
: O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
humans B-P
are I-P
a I-P
part I-P
of I-P
the I-P
society I-P
, I-P
and I-P
the I-P
society I-P
includes I-P
a I-P
wide I-P
variety I-P
of I-P
groups I-P
. O
Most O
of O
all O
, O
the B-C
groups I-C
play I-C
an I-C
essential I-C
role I-C
in I-C
the I-C
process I-C
of I-C
socialization I-C
, I-C
from I-C
children I-C
to I-C
adults I-C
. O
We B-P
begin I-P
taking I-P
part I-P
in I-P
groups I-P
or I-P
organizations I-P
during I-P
the I-P
early I-P
days I-P
of I-P
life I-P
, I-P
and I-P
especially I-P
most I-P
people I-P
continue I-P
their I-P
social I-P
participation I-P
in I-P
all I-P
through I-P
life I-P
. O
By B-P
making I-P
teamwork I-P
, I-P
the I-P
children I-P
in I-P
schools I-P
may I-P
learn I-P
to I-P
how I-P
to I-P
get I-P
along I-P
with I-P
others I-P
. O
As B-P
university I-P
students I-P
, I-P
it I-P
is I-P
likely I-P
for I-P
them I-P
to I-P
join I-P
student I-P
organization I-P
of I-P
their I-P
major I-P
in I-P
order I-P
to I-P
expand I-P
their I-P
experiences I-P
or I-P
communicate I-P
with I-P
others I-P
. O
After B-P
graduating I-P
from I-P
schools I-P
, I-P
employees I-P
might I-P
go I-P
to I-P
business I-P
associations I-P
for I-P
various I-P
business I-P
resources I-P
and I-P
benefits I-P
. O
Thus O
, O
almost B-C
of I-C
us I-C
live I-C
in I-C
the I-C
environment I-C
of I-C
groups I-C
. O
By B-C
participating I-C
in I-C
an I-C
organization I-C
, I-C
it I-C
is I-C
a I-C
positive I-C
way I-C
for I-C
people I-C
to I-C
obtain I-C
some I-C
experiences I-C
on I-C
a I-C
particular I-C
purpose I-C
. O
A B-P
solid I-P
group I-P
can I-P
be I-P
a I-P
suited I-P
environment I-P
, I-P
which I-P
provides I-P
people I-P
to I-P
improve I-P
themselves I-P
or I-P
broaden I-P
their I-P
horizons I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
as B-P
a I-P
student I-P
majoring I-P
in I-P
mass I-P

, I-P
I I-P
have I-P
taken I-P
part I-P
in I-P
mass I-P
media I-P
student I-P
group I-P
for I-P
a I-P
year I-P
. O
When B-P
being I-P
in I-P
the I-P
department I-P
of I-P
art I-P
, I-P
I I-P
have I-P
not I-P
only I-P
learned I-P
how I-P
to I-P
do I-P
a I-P
project I-P
, I-P
but I-P
also I-P
known I-P
some I-P
famous I-P
artists I-P
during I-P
the I-P

Above O
all O
, O
it B-P
is I-P
advantage I-P
which I-P
increase I-P
an I-P
opportunity I-P
on I-P
my I-P
resume I-P
for I-P
the I-P
sake I-P
of I-P
getting I-P
a I-P
better I-P
job I-P
. O
Furthermore O
, O
groups B-C

organizations I-C
would I-C
lead I-C
people I-C

Should O

Some O
people O
believe O
that O

the O
college O

for O
any O
citizen O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
individuals B-M
should I-M
pay I-M
their I-M
college I-M

because O
it B-C
would I-C
cost I-C
too I-C

, I-C
the I-C
college I-C
education I-C
is I-C
a I-C
personal I-C

choice I-C
, I-C
and I-C
there I-C
are I-C
many I-C
ways I-C
to I-C
fund I-C
a I-C
college I-C
education I-C
. O
First O
, O
making B-C
college I-C
education I-C
free I-C
would I-C
cost I-C
too I-C
much I-C
. O
It B-P
would I-P
divert I-P
public I-P
funds I-P
from I-P
other I-P
needs I-P
such I-P
as I-P
law I-P
enforcement I-P
, I-P
infrastructure I-P
and I-P
so I-P
forth I-P
. O
There B-P
are I-P
many I-P
other I-P
needs I-P
which I-P
should I-P
come I-P
first I-P
, I-P
such I-P
as I-P
providing I-P
health I-P

to I-P
all I-P
American I-P
, I-P

improving I-P
public I-P

In O

, O
it B-P
would I-P
cause I-P

taxes I-P
again I-P
and I-P
again I-P
to I-P

Consequently O
, O
it B-P
would I-P
affect I-P
all I-P
taxpayers I-P
whether I-P

not I-P
they I-P
benefit I-P
from I-P
the I-P

Second O

it B-P
is I-P

everyone I-P

other I-P
funds I-P

In O
addition O
, O
the B-P
government I-P
already I-P
helps I-P
pay I-P
college I-P
expense I-P
through I-P
indirect I-P
means I-P
. O
They B-P
often I-P
provide I-P
services I-P

as I-P

They B-P
also I-P
provide I-P

academic I-P

While B-P
the I-P
money I-P

not I-P
given I-P

these I-P

are I-P
not I-P

In O
short O
, O
the B-M
individual I-M
should I-M

it B-C
is I-C

he B-P

He B-P
may I-P

No O

it B-P

most I-P
up I-P

he B-C
can I-C

most I-P

course O

I B-M

I B-P

we B-P

require I-P
us I-P
to I-P

such I-P

math I-P

reading I-P

I B-P

every I-P

I B-M
agree I-M

the I-M
idea I-M

Some O
important O
characteristics O
of O
a O
co O
- O
worker O
At O
work O
, O
you O
meet O
people O
with O
diverse O
backgrounds O
and O
you O
are O
required O
to O
maintain O
sound O
relationships O
with O
many O
of O
them O
in O
order O
to O
have O
a O
pleasant O
work O
environment O
. O
However O
, O
the O
relationship O
you O
need O
to O
maintain O
with O
your O
co O
- O
worker O
is O
the O
most O
important O
one O
since O
he O
or O
she O
is O
the O
person O
who O
works O
very O
closely O
with O
you O
, O
and O
in O
most O
instances O
you O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
him O
or O
her O
. O
Therefore O
in O
my O
view O
, O
a B-M
good I-M
co I-M
- I-M
worker I-M
needs I-M
to I-M
have I-M
three I-M
most I-M
important I-M
characteristics I-M
such I-M
as I-M
cooperation I-M
, I-M
trustworthiness I-M
, I-M
and I-M
fellowship I-M
. O
The B-P
co I-P
- I-P
workers I-P
should I-P
be I-P
cooperative I-P
with I-P
one I-P
another I-P
. O
If B-P
they I-P
do I-P
not I-P
cooperate I-P
, I-P
there I-P
will I-P
be I-P
lots I-P
of I-P
disputes I-P
. O
I B-P
once I-P
had I-P
a I-P
co I-P
- I-P
worker I-P
who I-P
was I-P
too I-P
family I-P
conscious I-P
. O
Therefore O
he B-P
always I-P
left I-P
office I-P
sharp I-P
on I-P
time I-P
without I-P
giving I-P
any I-P
consideration I-P
whether I-P
the I-P
work I-P
has I-P
been I-P
finished I-P
or I-P
not I-P
. O
Most B-P
of I-P
the I-P
time I-P
, I-P
I I-P
had I-P
to I-P
do I-P
his I-P
work I-P
in I-P
order I-P
to I-P
protect I-P
him I-P
from I-P
getting I-P
caught I-P
to I-P
the I-P
supervisor I-P
who I-P
was I-P
a I-P
very I-P
authoritative I-P
person I-P
. O
However O
, O
one B-P
day I-P
I I-P
wanted I-P
to I-P
be I-P
off I-P
early I-P
because I-P
I I-P
had I-P
to I-P
take I-P
my I-P
mother I-P
to I-P
the I-P
doctor I-P
. O
When B-P
I I-P
requested I-P
my I-P
co I-P
- I-P
worker I-P
to I-P
give I-P
a I-P
helping I-P
hand I-P
to I-P
finish I-P
my I-P
work I-P
early I-P
, I-P
he I-P
turned I-P
down I-P
my I-P
request I-P
giving I-P
a I-P
silly I-P
excuse I-P
. O
From B-P
that I-P
day I-P
onwards I-P
I I-P
did I-P
not I-P
offer I-P
him I-P
any I-P
support I-P
and I-P
finally I-P
he I-P
was I-P
transferred I-P
from I-P
our I-P
department I-P
to I-P
a I-P
distant I-P
location I-P
as I-P
a I-P
punishment I-P
for I-P
his I-P
irresponsibility I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
believe O
if B-C
the I-C
co I-C
- I-C
workers I-C
do I-C
not I-C
corporate I-C
with I-C
each I-C
other I-C
that I-C
would I-C
be I-C
devastating I-C
in I-C
a I-C
work I-C
environment I-C
. O
The B-C
co I-C
- I-C
workers I-C
need I-C
to I-C
trust I-C
each I-C
other I-C
. O
They B-P
should I-P
not I-P
act I-P
on I-P
suspicion I-P
. O
This B-P
is I-P
a I-P
very I-P
important I-P
aspect I-P
in I-P
the I-P
work I-P
environment I-P
. O
I B-P
came I-P
across I-P
a I-P
situation I-P
once I-P
such I-P
that I-P
one I-P
of I-P
my I-P
subordinates I-P
used I-P
to I-P
suspect I-P
his I-P
co I-P
- I-P
worker I-P
for I-P
carrying I-P
tales I-P
to I-P
me I-P
. O
To B-P
a I-P
certain I-P
extent I-P
his I-P
suspicion I-P
was I-P
valid I-P
as I-P
his I-P
co I-P
- I-P
worker I-P
made I-P
several I-P
attempts I-P
to I-P
highlight I-P
the I-P
drawbacks I-P
of I-P
him I-P
. O
However O
I B-P
never I-P
encourage I-P
tale I-P
carriers I-P
as I-P
a I-P
principle I-P
and I-P
therefore I-P
his I-P
co I-P
- I-P
worker I-P
gave I-P
up I-P
talking I-P
ill I-P
against I-P
him I-P
with I-P
me I-P
. O
But B-P
this I-P
mistrust I-P
continued I-P
and I-P
created I-P
very I-P
unpleasant I-P
situations I-P
for I-P
everybody I-P
in I-P
my I-P
department I-P
. O
Finally O
, O
the B-C
co I-C
- I-C
workers I-C
should I-C
believe I-C
in I-C
fellowship I-C
. O
This B-P
helps I-P
them I-P
to I-P
enjoy I-P
their I-P
work I-P
life I-P
while I-P

up I-P
very I-P

for O

I B-M
prefer I-M

First O
, O
the B-C
participant I-C
with I-C
the I-C

is I-C
still I-C
an I-C
important I-C
factor I-C
in I-C
studying I-C
. O
Working B-P
in I-P
group I-P
leads I-P
to I-P
more I-P
discussion I-P
and I-P
more I-P
opinion I-P
among I-P
the I-P
class I-P
. O
Consequently O
, O
the B-P
discussion I-P
class I-P
results I-P
in I-P
expanded I-P
children I-P
vision I-P
and I-P
their I-P
respect I-P
to I-P
others I-P
roommate I-P
' I-P

ideas I-P
. O
Unlike B-P
the I-P

learning I-P
that I-P

friends I-P
. O
Second O
, O
classroom B-C
learning I-C
provides I-C
other I-C
activities I-C
than I-C
studying I-C
. O
During B-P
student I-P
' I-P
s I-P
free I-P
time I-P
, I-P
they I-P
have I-P
a I-P
number I-P
of I-P
activities I-P
that I-P
they I-P
can I-P
join I-P

such I-P

to I-P
more I-P
interact I-P
with I-P
their I-P
friends I-P

Connection B-P

they B-P

a I-P
chance I-P

the B-P

keeps I-P
the I-P
children I-P

home I-P
only I-P
. O
Lastly O
, O
in B-C
school I-C
, I-C
there I-C
are I-C
professors I-C
that I-C
guided I-C
you I-C
during I-C
you I-C
had I-C
a I-C
problem I-C
or I-C
needed I-C
an I-C
advice I-C
. O
The B-P
professor I-P
provides I-P
good I-P
answers I-P
to I-P
you I-P
. O
They B-P
do I-P
not I-P
mind I-P

you I-P

they I-P
never I-P

In O
contrast O

these I-P
aspects I-P
of I-P
the I-P
professor I-P

reduced I-P

. O
The B-P
professor I-P

been I-P

there B-P

from B-P
the I-P

the I-P

Removing B-C

developing I-P
their I-P
students I-P
into I-P
well I-P
- I-P
rounded I-P

It B-P
is I-P
more I-P

person I-P
to I-P

Success B-P

life I-P
should I-P
be I-P
the I-P
ultimate I-P
goal I-P

a I-P

which I-P
requires I-P

also I-P
practical I-P
life I-P
skills I-P

communication I-P
skills I-P

spirit I-P

Thus O
, O
school B-C

focus I-C
on I-C
the I-C
academic I-C
development I-C

I O
believe O

idea I-P

of I-P

Moreover O

parents B-P

The B-P

just I-P
a I-P
form I-P
of I-P
the I-P

the O

One B-P

that I-P

First O
, O
in B-C
childhood I-C
most I-C
people I-C

happier I-C

They B-P

A B-P
child I-P
' I-P
s I-P
daily I-P
life I-P
is I-P
school I-P
, I-P
playing I-P

sleeping I-P

For O
example O
, O
when B-P
I I-P
was I-P
young I-P
I I-P
just I-P
came I-P
home I-P
from I-P
school I-P

then I-P
I I-P
would I-P
took I-P
my I-P

go I-P
out I-P

with I-P
my I-P

my I-P

Moreover O
, O
I B-P
did I-P
not I-P
have I-P
to I-P
worry I-P
about I-P
costs I-P
and I-P
other I-P
things I-P

I I-P
just I-P
had I-P

Also O
, O
people B-C
are I-C
most I-C
creative I-C
when I-C
they I-C

children I-C

children B-P
imagine I-P

just I-P
to I-P

childhood B-P

the I-P
period I-P
where I-P
people I-P
go I-P

school B-C

you I-P

my B-P
father I-P

However O
, O
how O
early O
the O

a O
difficult O
issue O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O

staying B-M

the I-M
parents I-M

time I-M
does I-M
more I-M
benefits I-M
than I-M
disadvantages I-M
to I-M
the I-M
young I-M
adult I-M
. O
My O
opinion O
is O
based O
on O
creating O
memories O
with O
parents O
, O
saving O
money O
, O
and O
taking O
advice O
from O
parents O
. O
First O
of O
all O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
significant O
upsides O
is O
that O
the B-P
young I-P
adult I-P
can I-P
have I-P
more I-P
experience I-P
with I-P
his I-P
parents I-P
. O
The B-P
young I-P
adult I-P
has I-P
to I-P
try I-P
to I-P
create I-P
memories I-P
with I-P
his I-P
dad I-P
and I-P
mom I-P
in I-P
the I-P
early I-P
age I-P
. O
When B-P
having I-P
a I-P
job I-P
, I-P
it I-P
is I-P
of I-P
low I-P
possibilities I-P
to I-P
work I-P
in I-P
his I-P
hometown I-P
. O
If B-P
he I-P
lives I-P
with I-P
his I-P
parents I-P
for I-P
longer I-P
time I-P
, I-P
they I-P
have I-P
more I-P
chances I-P
to I-P
share I-P
the I-P
feelings I-P
, I-P
exercise I-P
, I-P
and I-P
travel I-P
together I-P
. O
All B-P
memories I-P
become I-P
priceless I-P
treasure I-P
as I-P
time I-P
passes I-P
by I-P
. O
Thus O
, O
I O
think O
undergoing B-C
with I-C
parents I-C
is I-C
worthwhile I-C
. O
Furthermore O
, O
living B-P
at I-P
home I-P
costs I-P
less I-P
than I-P
living I-P
outside I-P
. O
Learning B-P
to I-P
be I-P
independent I-P
means I-P
that I-P
the I-P
young I-P
adult I-P
needs I-P
to I-P
leave I-P
home I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
he B-P
may I-P
have I-P
to I-P
rent I-P
a I-P
house I-P
and I-P
the I-P
rental I-P
would I-P
become I-P
a I-P
burden I-P
for I-P
parents I-P
. O
Moreover O
, O
another B-P
daily I-P
expense I-P
is I-P
also I-P
the I-P
considerable I-P
outgoings I-P
. O
Spending B-P
much I-P
money I-P
may I-P
not I-P
result I-P
in I-P
what I-P
the I-P
parents I-P
expect I-P
their I-P
children I-P
to I-P
be I-P
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
the B-C
parents I-C
can I-C
save I-C
money I-C
, I-C
if I-C
their I-C
children I-C
live I-C
with I-C
them I-C
longer I-C
. O
The O
third O
convincing O
reason O
is O
that O
the B-P
young I-P
adult I-P
needs I-P
father I-P
and I-P
mother I-P
' I-P
s I-P
suggestions I-P
. O
When B-P
in I-P
dilemma I-P
, I-P
the I-P
parents I-P
can I-P
comfort I-P
him I-P
and I-P
give I-P
him I-P
a I-P
big I-P
hand I-P
. O
They B-P
are I-P
the I-P
people I-P
who I-P
are I-P
most I-P
familiar I-P
with I-P
him I-P
can I-P
give I-P
a I-P
suitable I-P
advice I-P
and I-P
lead I-P
him I-P
to I-P
the I-P
right I-P
way I-P

If B-P
the I-P
parents I-P
do I-P
not I-P
help I-P
him I-P
immediately I-P
, I-P
he I-P
would I-P
have I-P
to I-P
suffer I-P
more I-P
pain I-P
. O
Hence O
, O
taking B-C
advice I-C
from I-C
parents I-C
, I-C
the I-C
young I-C

can I-C
go I-C
through I-C

easily I-C

To O
sum O
up O
, O
living B-C

advice I-C

the B-C

that O

I O

more I-M

In O

I O

two O
reasons O

First O
of O
all O
, O
a B-P
mistake I-P
does I-P
not I-P
last I-P
for I-P
a I-P
long I-P
time I-P
but I-P
a I-P
friendship I-P
lasts I-P
forever I-P
. O
Anybody B-P
does I-P
not I-P
remember I-P
mistakes I-P
. O
If B-P
someone I-P
remembers I-P
mistake I-P
, I-P
he I-P
or I-P
she I-P
has I-P
a I-P
closed I-P
mind I-P
. O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
mistakes B-P
will I-P
be I-P
forgotten I-P
quickly I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
my B-P
friend I-P
Lee I-P
made I-P
a I-P
mistake I-P
that I-P
he I-P
broke I-P
my I-P
precious I-P
gift I-P
. O
However O
, O
I B-P
forgot I-P
about I-P
it I-P
just I-P
after I-P
two I-P
days I-P
, I-P
and I-P
I I-P
felt I-P
at I-P
peace I-P
with I-P
him I-P
. O
Some O
people O
might O
say O
I O
am O
silly O
, O
but O
I O
think O
mistake B-C
is I-C
more I-C
forgettable I-C
than I-C
friendship I-C
. O
Second O
, O
Everybody B-C
makes I-C
mistake I-C
. O
However O
, O
if B-P
you I-P
end I-P
a I-P
friendship I-P
whenever I-P
your I-P
friend I-P
makes I-P
a I-P
mistake I-P
, I-P
there I-P
will I-P
be I-P
no I-P
friends I-P
around I-P
you I-P
. O
I O
agree O
if B-P
a I-P
friend I-P
makes I-P
very I-P
a I-P
big I-P
mistake I-P
, I-P
we I-P
will I-P
need I-P
to I-P
end I-P
a I-P
friendship I-P
. O
However O
, O
when B-P
the I-P
mistake I-P
friend I-P
made I-P
was I-P
not I-P
a I-P
big I-P
problem I-P
, I-P
we I-P
need I-P
to I-P
understand I-P
friend I-P
and I-P
forgive I-P
it I-P
because O
a B-P
friend I-P
is I-P
a I-P
gift I-P
of I-P
our I-P
life I-P
. O
According B-P
to I-P
a I-P
research I-P

85 I-P

people I-P
answered I-P
that I-P
a I-P
best I-P

I O
think O
that O
a B-M
mistake I-M
can I-M
not I-M
brake I-M
friendship I-M
if I-M
it I-M
is I-M

Students O
should O
be O
required O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
tests O
The O
issue O
at O
hand O
is O
if O
the O
schools O
should O
require O
students O
to O
take O
regular O
standardized O
exams O
. O
This O
issue O
is O
important O
because O
nowadays O
many O
people O
cast O
doubt O
on O
it O
. O
However O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
standardized B-M
tests I-M
are I-M
valuable I-M
option I-M
for I-M
educational I-M
system I-M
as I-M
long I-M
as I-M
it I-M
would I-M
help I-M
teachers I-M
to I-M
know I-M
if I-M
the I-M
students I-M
are I-M
really I-M
getting I-M
knowledge I-M
. O
Firstly O
, O
standardized B-C
tests I-C
are I-C
preferable I-C
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
they B-P
help I-P
teachers I-P
to I-P
fairly I-P
grade I-P
the I-P
students I-P
. O
For O
example O
some B-P
students I-P
are I-P
not I-P
so I-P
active I-P
on I-P
the I-P
lessons I-P
, I-P
cause I-P
they I-P
are I-P
already I-P
familiar I-P
with I-P
the I-P
issue I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
exams B-P
could I-P
be I-P
the I-P
only I-P
way I-P
for I-P
teachers I-P
to I-P
see I-P
the I-P
real I-P
abilities I-P
of I-P
those I-P
students I-P
. O
In O
addition O
, O
many B-P
teachers I-P
rely I-P
only I-P
on I-P
the I-P
exam I-P
results I-P
while I-P
grading I-P
the I-P
class I-P
, O
so O
the B-P
usage I-P
of I-P
standardized I-P
tests I-P
is I-P
the I-P
superior I-P
option I-P
for I-P
them I-P
. O
Additionally O
, O
standardized B-P
tests I-P
can I-P
be I-P
good I-P
chance I-P
for I-P
students I-P
to I-P
apply I-P
their I-P
knowledge I-P
on I-P
practice I-P
. O
Since O
, O
some B-P
students I-P
may I-P
get I-P
used I-P
to I-P
simply I-P
rewriting I-P
solved I-P
problems I-P
from I-P
the I-P
blackboard I-P
, O
so O
they B-P
will I-P
never I-P
try I-P
to I-P
solve I-P
problems I-P
on I-P
their I-P
own I-P
. O
However O
, O
standardized B-P
tests I-P
offer I-P
them I-P
such I-P
chance I-P
. O
Thus O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
schools B-C
should I-C
require I-C
students I-C
to I-C
take I-C
standardized I-C
tests I-C
, I-C
as I-C
long I-C
as I-C
this I-C
option I-C
helps I-C
to I-C
both I-C
sides I-C
. O
Finally O
, O
I O
think O
that O
requirement B-C
to I-C
take I-C
standardized I-C
tests I-C
is I-C
the I-C
right I-C
choice I-C
, O
since O
in B-P
this I-P
case I-P
teachers I-P
can I-P
compare I-P
the I-P
level I-P
of I-P
knowledge I-P
of I-P
different I-P
students I-P
. O
In B-P
any I-P
class I-P
there I-P
will I-P
be I-P
students I-P
who I-P
will I-P
show I-P
low I-P
academic I-P
performance I-P
, I-P
so I-P
teachers I-P
could I-P
work I-P
with I-P
them I-P
more I-P
intensively I-P
. O
I O
support O
the O
points O
of O
those O
who O
say O
that O
standardized B-P
tests I-P
are I-P
required I-P
over I-P
those I-P
who I-P
don I-P
’ I-P
t I-P
because O
if B-P
the I-P
teacher I-P
would I-P
know I-P
the I-P
level I-P
of I-P
each I-P
student I-P
he I-P
would I-P
fairly I-P
share I-P
his I-P
time I-P
to I-P
all I-P
of I-P
them I-P
. O
Ultimately O
I O
feel O
that O
schools B-M
which I-M
obligate I-M
their I-M
students I-M
to I-M
take I-M
standardized I-M
tests I-M
are I-M
right I-M
. O
I O
belive O
this O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
these B-C
schools I-C
can I-C
qualitatively I-C
check I-C
if I-C
they I-C
are I-C
giving I-C
an I-C
appropriate I-C
education I-C

People B-P
who I-P

calmer I-C

Because O
they B-P
already I-P
have I-P
such I-P

they B-P

more I-P

Although O

people O
prefer O
communicating O
by O
telephone O
or O
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
, O
personally O
I O
believe O
that O
communicating B-M
by I-M
e I-M
- I-M
mails I-M
or I-M
voice I-M
mails I-M
is I-M
better I-M
. O
There O
are O
several O
reasons O
to O
support O
this O
idea O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
in O
this O
essay O
. O
Firstly O
, O
communicating B-C
by I-C
e I-C
- I-C
mail I-C
is I-C
easy I-C
. O
Many B-P
people I-P
have I-P
problems I-P
with I-P
calling I-P
a I-P
person I-P
that I-P
they I-P
are I-P
not I-P
acquainted I-P
with I-P
. O
In B-P
this I-P
case I-P
it I-P
is I-P
not I-P
so I-P
difficult I-P
to I-P
write I-P
an I-P
e I-P
- I-P
mail I-P
or I-P
to I-P
leave I-P
a I-P
voice I-P
mail I-P
because O
even B-P
shy I-P
people I-P
feel I-P
themselves I-P
more I-P
confident I-P
. O
Secondly O
, O
you B-C
can I-C
write I-C
an I-C
e I-C
- I-C
mail I-C
at I-C
any I-C
time I-C
of I-C
the I-C
day I-C
. O
As O
for O
me O
, O
I B-P
work I-P
and I-P
study I-P
at I-P
the I-P
university I-P
and I-P
I I-P
don I-P
' I-P
t I-P
have I-P
spare I-P
time I-P
during I-P
the I-P
day I-P
. O
I B-P
get I-P
home I-P
at I-P
about I-P
midnight I-P
and I-P
I I-P
still I-P
need I-P
to I-P
answer I-P
some I-P
questions I-P
and I-P
to I-P
solve I-P
some I-P
routine I-P
problems I-P
. O
I B-P
might I-P
not I-P
have I-P
time I-P
to I-P
call I-P
a I-P
person I-P
or I-P
to I-P
meet I-P
with I-P
him I-P
or I-P
her I-P
in I-P
an I-P
appropriate I-P
time I-P
so O
for B-P
me I-P
it I-P
is I-P
better I-P
to I-P
leave I-P
a I-P
voice I-P
mail I-P
. O
Thirdly O
, O
when B-C
you I-C
write I-C
an I-C
e I-C
- I-C
mail I-C
you I-C
have I-C
enough I-C
time I-C
to I-C
think I-C
carefully I-C
about I-C
what I-C
you I-C
are I-C
writing I-C
and I-C
how I-C
it I-C
would I-C
be I-C
better I-C
to I-C
express I-C
yourself I-C
. O
For O
example O
, O
you B-P
can I-P
change I-P
the I-P
word I-P
order I-P
or I-P
you I-P
can I-P
choose I-P
more I-P
appropriate I-P
style I-P
to I-P
sound I-P
more I-P
polite I-P
. O
When B-P
you I-P
speak I-P
face I-P
- I-P
to I-P
- I-P
face I-P
you I-P
are I-P
not I-P
as I-P
able I-P
to I-P
control I-P
every I-P
word I-P
as I-P
you I-P
are I-P
when I-P
you I-P
write I-P
an I-P
e I-P
- I-P
mail I-P
. O
And O
finally O
, O
there B-C
is I-C
no I-C
chance I-C
to I-C
disturb I-C
people I-C
by I-C
sending I-C
them I-C
an I-C
e I-C
- I-C
mail I-C
. O
You B-P
should I-P
not I-P
worry I-P
about I-P
interrupting I-P
an I-P
important I-P
conversation I-P
or I-P
some I-P
other I-P
business I-P
. O
To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
for O
me O
both O
options O
of O
communicating O
are O
possible O
, O
but O
if O
this O
is O
an O

Every O
parents O
expect O

to O
be O
outstanding O
and O
successful O
. O
In O
order O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
they O
start O

In O

In O
my O
opinion O

I O
agree O
that O
children B-M
should I-M
learn I-M
music I-M

art I-M
in I-M
a I-M
young I-M
age I-M
because O
they B-C
do I-C
contribute I-C
several I-C
merits I-C
to I-C
them I-C

First O
, O
it B-C
' I-C
s I-C
very I-C
suitable I-C
for I-C
children I-C
to I-C
develop I-C
senses I-C
of I-C
music I-C
and I-C
art I-C
when I-C
they I-C
are I-C
young I-C
. O
Children B-P
absorb I-P
things I-P
quickly I-P
and I-P
they I-P
bear I-P
exact I-P
the I-P
ability I-P
needed I-P
in I-P
music I-P
and I-P
art I-P
- I-P
imagination I-P
. O
Music B-P
and I-P
art I-P
are I-P
not I-P
like I-P
math I-P
or I-P
language I-P
which I-P
has I-P
more I-P
strict I-P
rules I-P
. O
They B-P
are I-P
more I-P
abstract I-P
, I-P
requiring I-P
creativity I-P
and I-P
imagination I-P
to I-P
be I-P
enriched I-P
. O
Children B-P
are I-P
privileged I-P
to I-P
have I-P
these I-P
abilities I-P
because O
they B-P
are I-P
given I-P
more I-P
freedom I-P
and I-P
their I-P
imagination I-P
has I-P
not I-P
yet I-P
been I-P
killed I-P
due I-P
to I-P
reality I-P
circumstances I-P
. O
Even B-P
if I-P
their I-P
performances I-P
are I-P
just I-P
some I-P
simple I-P
drawings I-P
and I-P
melodies I-P
, I-P
music I-P
and I-P
art I-P
still I-P
bring I-P
out I-P
children I-P
' I-P
s I-P
joy I-P
of I-P
flying I-P
in I-P
imagination I-P
. O
Second O
, O
music B-P
and I-P
art I-P
are I-P
life I-P
- I-P
long I-P
cultivation I-P
worthy I-P
of I-P
investing I-P
. O
They B-P
teach I-P
us I-P
how I-P
to I-P
appreciate I-P
beauty I-P
and I-P
express I-P
feelings I-P
in I-P
a I-P
creative I-P
way I-P
. O
They B-P
are I-P
essential I-P
to I-P
our I-P
spiritual I-P
life I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
even B-C
if I-C
children I-C
are I-C
not I-C
going I-C
to I-C
be I-C
great I-C
musicians I-C
or I-C
artists I-C
, I-C
learning I-C
music I-C
and I-C
art I-C
is I-C
still I-C
worthy I-C
because O
it B-P
can I-P
nourish I-P
your I-P
temper I-P
and I-P
serve I-P
as I-P
a I-P
leisure I-P
. O
However O
, O
some O
people O
might O
argue O
that O
parents B-C
shouldn I-C
' I-C
t I-C
put I-C
so I-C
much I-C
stress I-C
on I-C
children I-C
, O
since O
learning B-P
too I-P
many I-P
skills I-P
seems I-P
to I-P
be I-P
a I-P
burden I-P
for I-P
them I-P
. O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it B-P
depends I-P
on I-P
how I-P
you I-P
value I-P
these I-P
learning I-P
activities I-P
to I-P
be I-P
like I-P
. O
If B-P
parents I-P
push I-P
their I-P
5 I-P
years I-P
old I-P
child I-P
to I-P
play I-P
piano I-P
8 I-P
hours I-P
a I-P
day I-P
just I-P
like I-P
a I-P
professional I-P
performer I-P
, I-P
that I-P
might I-P
be I-P
too I-P
much I-P
. O
In B-P
a I-P
child I-P
stage I-P
, I-P
music I-P
and I-P
art I-P
are I-P
more I-P
like I-P
an I-P
open I-P
door I-P
to I-P
introduce I-P
the I-P

world I-P
than I-P

In O
this O
way O
, O
it B-P
will I-P
not I-P
be I-P
such I-P
pressure I-P
on I-P
children I-P
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
young B-M
age I-M
is I-M
the I-M
perfect I-M
time I-M
for I-M
children I-M
to I-M

they B-C

valuable I-C

only I-C
in I-C
their I-C

in I-C
every I-C

Music B-C

can I-C

I B-P
live I-P

' I-P
t I-P
have I-P
enough I-P
parking I-P

for I-P
the I-P

So O
, O
with B-P
the I-P
stations I-P
increased I-P
people I-P
are I-P
willing I-P
to I-P
take I-P
a I-P

drive I-P
on I-P
their I-P
own I-P

Second O
, O
a B-P

make I-P

lot I-P
of I-P

pollutions I-P

the I-P
world I-P
. O

if I-P
we I-P

forty I-P

than O
working O
at O

In O
my O
opinion O

I O

that O
working B-M

worse I-M
and I-M
less I-M

First O
of O
all O
, O
while B-C
working I-C

people I-C
can I-C
interact I-C
with I-C

They B-P
can I-P
either I-P

from I-P
colleges I-P

discuss I-P
about I-P
the I-P

Think B-P
about I-P
the I-P
big I-P
project I-P
that I-P
a I-P

Second O
, O

disadvantages I-C

no I-C
doubt I-C
lower I-C
the I-C
efficiency I-C

For O
example O
, O
people B-P
are I-P
easily I-P
distracted I-P

working I-P

It B-P
' I-P

hard I-P
to I-P
concentrate I-P

work I-P
if I-P
people I-P

grab I-P
the I-P
TV I-P

some I-P
junk I-P

right I-P

In O
addition O
, O
while B-P
people I-P
are I-P
working I-P
at I-P
home I-P
, I-P
there I-P
will I-P
be I-P
no I-P
one I-P
supervising I-P
them I-P

thus I-P
raises I-P
the I-P
chance I-P

Moreover O
, O
people B-P
who I-P
work I-P
at I-P

In O
conclusion O

working B-M

the I-M

someone I-P

As O

an I-C

One B-P
of I-P
the I-P
other I-P
factors I-P
for I-P

is I-P
effective I-P
commuincation I-P

By B-P

we I-P

therefore O
we B-P
will I-P
have I-P
a I-P
wide I-P
network I-P
of I-P
communication I-P
. O
Commuincation B-P
can I-P
bring I-P
many I-P
benefits I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
if B-P
you I-P
need I-P
help I-P
with I-P
getting I-P
a I-P
job I-P

by I-P
commuincating I-P
with I-P
people I-P
offering I-P
jobs I-P
whom I-P
you I-P
treat I-P
well I-P

therefore O
they B-P
respect I-P
you I-P
as I-P
well I-P

you I-P

your I-P

Or O
, O
if B-P

a I-P
salesman I-P
in I-P
a I-P
store I-P

any I-P

place I-P

by I-P
relating I-P

your I-P

you I-P

it O
comes O

the O
debate O
whether O

positive O
influences O
on O
people O

Some O

In O

the B-M
advertising I-M

The B-P
key I-P

they I-P
persistently I-P
keep I-P
track I-P

they I-P
can I-P
successfully I-P
prevent I-P
themselves I-P
from I-P
those I-P
temptations I-P
. O
It B-P
will I-P
be I-P
not I-P
persuasive I-P
if I-P
people I-P
just I-P
blame I-P
the I-P
advertising I-P
sector I-P
of I-P
a I-P
fast I-P
- I-P
food I-P
company I-P
for I-P
making I-P
them I-P
so I-P
fat I-P

not I-P
reassess I-P
their I-P
own I-P
behaviors I-P
. O
Second O
, O
in B-P
the I-P
era I-P
when I-P
people I-P
are I-P
becoming I-P
conscious I-P
of I-P
a I-P
healthier I-P
lifestyle I-P

some I-P
companies I-P

actually I-P

at I-P
this I-P
rising I-P
trend I-P

start I-P
to I-P
promote I-P
healthy I-P
foods I-P

In O
other O
words O

advertising B-C
may I-C
even I-C
bring I-C
healthier I-C
eating I-C
habits I-C
to I-C
the I-C
people I-C
. O
Think B-P
about I-P
the I-P
recently I-P
popular I-P
organic I-P
foods I-P
that I-P
are I-P
claimed I-P
to I-P
grow I-P

those I-P
crude I-P

which I-P
less I-P

are I-P
added I-P

These B-P
are I-P
the I-P
main I-P
traits I-P
that I-P

hitting I-P

, O
when B-P

in I-P

they I-P
would I-P
be I-P

As O
a O
case O

more B-P

would I-P
make I-P

other I-P
that I-P
only I-P
their I-P

As O
a O

they B-C

out I-C
of I-C
school I-C
to I-C
solve I-C
their I-C

better I-C
. O
Second O
, O
it B-C
would I-C
improve I-C
students I-C
' I-C
social I-C
behavior I-C
. O
If B-P
students I-P
only I-P
rely I-P
on I-P
concepts I-P
and I-P

theorically I-P
, I-P
they I-P
would I-P
not I-P

They B-P

obtain I-P
the I-P

Thus O
, O
if B-P
they I-P

they I-P
can I-P

improve I-P

these B-P

As O
a O

when B-C

he I-C

First O
, O
besides B-P
the I-P

very I-P
vital I-P
effects I-P
on I-P
human I-P
' I-P
s I-P
healthfulness I-P

In O
my O
viewpoint O
, O
our B-P
body I-P
and I-P
moral I-P
health I-P
depend I-P
to I-P
physical I-P
activities I-P
directly I-P
. O
As O
a O
case O
in O
point O
, O
last B-P
month I-P
I I-P
had I-P
very I-P
difficult I-P
exam I-P
that I-P
I I-P
forced I-P
to I-P
study I-P
for I-P
one I-P
week I-P
back I-P
to I-P
back I-P
. O
After B-P
that I-P
exam I-P
, I-P
I I-P
felt I-P
depressed I-P
and I-P
exhausted I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
I B-P
decided I-P
to I-P
go I-P
to I-P

to I-P
recuperate I-P
and I-P
it I-P
responded I-P
very I-P
well I-P
! O
As O
a O
result O
, O
sports B-C
are I-C
necessary I-C
for I-C
students I-C
to I-C
acquire I-C
their I-C
energy I-C
and I-C
health I-C
. O
Second O
, O
besides B-P
the I-P
academic I-P
knowledge I-P
, I-P
the I-P
awareness I-P
of I-P
social I-P
behavior I-P
is I-P
an I-P
important I-P
factor I-P
for I-P
human I-P
' I-P
s I-P
life I-P
. O
As O
a O
practical O
epitome O
, O
students B-P
should I-P
be I-P
prepared I-P
to I-P
present I-P
in I-P
society I-P
after I-P
their I-P
graduation I-P
. O
Thus O
social B-P
activities I-P
can I-P
help I-P
them I-P
to I-P
be I-P
familiar I-P
with I-P
other I-P
' I-P
s I-P
mind I-P
and I-P
different I-P
environment I-P
. O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
social B-P
groups I-P
and I-P
classes I-P
are I-P
significant I-P
factors I-P
to I-P
prepare I-P
students I-P
to I-P
contribute I-P
in I-P
discussion I-P
and I-P
encounter I-P
real I-P
social I-P
environment I-P

So O
, O
social B-C
activities I-C
have I-C
same I-C
rights I-C
to I-C
receive I-C
monetary I-C
support I-C
. O
Moreover O

they B-C
bring I-C

have I-C
more I-C

just I-P

., I-P
studying I-P
as I-P
a I-P
student I-P
, I-P
after I-P

be I-P
boring I-P

we I-P
wouldn I-P

good I-C

example O

everyone B-P
around I-P
me I-P
speaks I-P
foreign I-P
language I-P
, I-P

then I-P
I I-P
have I-P
to I-P

myself I-P

communicate I-P

If B-P
I I-P

I I-P
could I-P
not I-P
even I-P
buy I-P
food I-P

sacrifice I-P
my I-P

This B-P
environment I-P
makes I-P
me I-P

English B-P

there I-P
are I-P

The B-P
only I-P
language I-P

I I-P

I B-P

This B-P

In O

' I-P

For O
example O

evaluation B-P
made I-P

similar I-P
to I-P

from I-P
customer I-P
that I-P

owners I-P

know I-P

their I-P

Students B-P
might I-P
complain I-P
about I-P
their I-P
teachers I-P
spoke I-P
too I-P
fast I-P
that I-P
students I-P
could I-P
not I-P
catch I-P
up I-P
on I-P
information I-P
. O
Consequently O
, O
teachers B-P
could I-P
improve I-P
themselves I-P
by I-P
speaking I-P
slower I-P
to I-P
make I-P
sure I-P
that I-P

all I-P

that I-P
they I-P
want I-P

Therefore O
, O
evaluating B-C

improve I-C
teachers I-C
' I-C
performance I-C

Additionally O
, O
this B-C
evaluation I-C

quality I-C

Consequently O

When B-P

school I-P

For O

in B-P
many I-P
cooperation I-P
such I-P
as I-P
Microsoft I-P
that I-P

they B-P
have I-P

Schools B-P

Finally O
, O

who I-C
get I-C
the I-C
most I-C
advantage I-C

that I-P

, O
I O
saw O
some O
people O
stopped O
running O
while O
the O
others O
fought O
until O
their O
last O
minute O
. O
At O
some O
moment O
, O
my O
body O
was O
telling O
me O
to O
stop O
but O
the O
choice O
that O
I O
made O
was O
on O
the O
contrary O
. O
I O
did O
not O
stop O
and O
won O
a O
medal O
goals O
in O
my O
life O
at O
the O
age O
of O
nearly O
thirty O
. O
From O
this O
experience O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
a B-M
person I-M
should I-M
keep I-M
trying I-M
for I-M
his I-M
goals I-M
. O
Firstly O
, O
committing B-C
to I-C
our I-C
goal I-C
helps I-C
creating I-C
personal I-C
worth I-C
. O
For O
example O
, O
I B-P
realized I-P
the I-P
true I-P
potential I-P
of I-P
my I-P
body I-P
and I-P
mind I-P
as I-P
I I-P
decided I-P
to I-P
train I-P
myself I-P
hard I-P
. O
Even B-P
if I-P
I I-P
were I-P
not I-P
to I-P
win I-P
this I-P
medal I-P
, I-P
I I-P
acknowledged I-P
the I-P
great I-P
amount I-P
of I-P
my I-P
endeavor I-P
as I-P
I I-P
could I-P
keep I-P
my I-P
tired I-P
legs I-P
running I-P
. O
Secondly O
, O
one B-C
who I-C
learns I-C
the I-C
great I-C
difficulty I-C
will I-C
become I-C
stronger I-C
. O
I B-P
remembered I-P
how I-P
I I-P
was I-P
suffered I-P
in I-P
the I-P
first I-P
round I-P
when I-P
I I-P
was I-P
last I-P
person I-P
who I-P
touched I-P
the I-P
line I-P
. O
However O
, O
I B-P
did I-P
not I-P
give I-P
up I-P
, I-P
and I-P
believed I-P
that I-P
I I-P
would I-P
be I-P
better I-P
in I-P
the I-P
next I-P
round I-P
because O
I B-P
knew I-P
how I-P
to I-P
improve I-P
myself I-P
. O
I B-P
had I-P
been I-P
a I-P
loser I-P
for I-P
a I-P
thousand I-P
time I-P
before I-P
the I-P
first I-P
winning I-P
, I-P
and I-P
suffering I-P
from I-P
losing I-P
in I-P
each I-P
competition I-P
makes I-P
me I-P
stronger I-P
. O
Thirdly O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
we B-P
, I-P
as I-P
an I-P
average I-P
people I-P
, I-P
might I-P
feel I-P
that I-P
the I-P
responsibility I-P
to I-P
our I-P
goal I-P
is I-P
too I-P
heavy I-P
to I-P
carry I-P
on I-P
. O
I O
believe O
that O
the B-C
responsibility I-C
is I-C
worthy I-C
of I-C
carrying I-C
. O
When B-P
the I-P
distance I-P
is I-P
longer I-P
and I-P
harder I-P
to I-P
achieve I-P
, I-P
a I-P
runner I-P
who I-P
can I-P
go I-P
beyond I-P
his I-P
limit I-P
will I-P
proud I-P
of I-P
himself I-P
. O
He B-P
can I-P
feel I-P
the I-P
sweetness I-P
of I-P
triumph I-P
because O
he B-P
did I-P
not I-P
stop I-P
pursing I-P
his I-P
goal I-P
. O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
one B-M
should I-M
not I-M
give I-M
up I-M
, O
as O
the B-C
true I-C
reward I-C
is I-C
to I-C
have I-C
the I-C
dignity I-C
. O
Anyone B-C
who I-C
wants I-C
to I-C
achieve I-C
the I-C
goal I-C
should I-C
acknowledge I-C
that I-C
his I-C
effort I-C
and I-C
experience I-C
from I-C
suffering I-C
helps I-C
him I-C
understand I-C
his I-C
true I-C
potential I-C
and I-C
increase I-C
his I-C
strength I-C
, I-C
and I-C
ultimately I-C
, I-C
it I-C
will I-C
prompt I-C
him I-C
to I-C
be I-C
ready I-C
for I-C
overcoming I-C
the I-C
greater I-C

in I-C
his I-C

, O

In B-P
the I-P
past I-P

what I-P
they I-P
want I-P
to I-P
convey I-P
to I-P
students I-P
on I-P
the I-P

, I-P
resulting I-P
in I-P
a I-P
great I-P
waste I-P
of I-P
time I-P
and I-P
the I-P
fatigue I-P
of I-P

. O
With B-P
the I-P
advent I-P
of I-P
iPads I-P
in I-P
e I-P
- I-P
learning I-P
, I-P
paper I-P

become I-P
unnecessary I-P
, I-P
so I-P
does I-P
the I-P

it O
is O
because O
all B-P
the I-P
knowledge I-P

the I-P
iPads I-P

previous I-P

thousands I-P

By B-P

Another B-C
advantage I-C

their I-C
capabilities I-C

It B-P

It B-P

valuable I-P

them I-P

Historic B-P

whether I-P

as O

the B-M

attention I-M

Traditional B-C
skills I-C

important I-C
role I-C
in I-C
modern I-C

Although O
technology B-P
takes I-P
convenience I-P

humankind I-P

it B-P
also I-P
contributes I-P
to I-P

like I-P
sedentary I-P

. O
Instead O
, O
traditional B-P
ways I-P

is I-P
a I-P
great I-P
complimentary I-P
for I-P
modern I-P

and I-P
highlight I-P
the I-P
importance I-P
of I-P
work I-P
life I-P
balance I-P
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
traditional B-P
skills I-P
rely I-P
little I-P
on I-P
fossil I-P
energy I-P
, O
it B-P
is I-P
more I-P
environmentally I-P
- I-P
friendly I-P
, I-P
which I-P
should I-P
be I-P
promoted I-P
to I-P
reduce I-P
the I-P
threat I-P

. O
Furthermore O
those B-P
tradition I-P

related I-P
things I-P
convey I-P
traditional I-P
culture I-P
and I-P
values I-P
. O
These B-P
are I-P
important I-P
foundation I-P
of I-P
modern I-P
civilization I-P
. O
Protection B-P
of I-P
tradition I-P
can I-P
provide I-P
the I-P
possibility I-P
to I-P
better I-P
understand I-P
ancient I-P
culture I-P
and I-P
utilize I-P
them I-P
to I-P
tackle I-P
modern I-P
problems I-P
. O
Some O
people O
who O
hold O
different O
viewpoints O
may O
advocate O
that O
protecting B-C
traditions I-C
consume I-C
too I-C
much I-C
financial I-C
budget I-C
compared I-C
with I-C
the I-C
incoming I-C
it I-C
takes I-C
. O
In O

of O
the O
fact O
this B-P
kind I-P
of I-P
business I-P
bring I-P
limited I-P
contribution I-P

, O
it O
should O
be O
emphasized O
that O
the B-P
expense I-P
is I-P
trivial I-P
compared I-P
with I-P
the I-P
potential I-P
value I-P
of I-P
traditions I-P
. O
Therefore O
the B-C
government I-C
authorities I-C
and I-C
education I-C
institutes I-C
should I-C
work I-C
closely I-C
together I-C
to I-C
promote I-C
the I-C
traditional I-C
skills I-C

so I-C
as I-C

Paying O

the O

Some O

that O
. O
Personally O

I O

this O

. O
To O
start O
with O
, O
all B-C
people I-C
who I-C
are I-C
able I-C
to I-C
work I-C
should I-C
pay I-C
tax I-C
to I-C
the I-C
government I-C
, O
as O
it B-P
is I-P
the I-P
most I-P
important I-P
source I-P
of I-P
government I-P
' I-P

revenue I-P
, I-P
which I-P
is I-P
mainly I-P
used I-P

serve I-P
all I-P

For O
example O
, O
a B-P
large I-P
proportion I-P
of I-P
the I-P
tax I-P
is I-P
spent I-P
on I-P
national I-P
defence I-P
and I-P
in I-P
maintaining I-P
social I-P
stability I-P
, O
so O
that O
every B-P
one I-P
can I-P
work I-P
and I-P
live I-P
in I-P
a I-P
peaceful I-P
environment I-P
. O
The B-P
tax I-P
is I-P
also I-P
used I-P
to I-P
pay I-P
the I-P
salaries I-P
of I-P
workers I-P
working I-P
in I-P
public I-P
service I-P
sectors I-P
, I-P
such I-P
as I-P
teachers I-P

police I-P
officers I-P
. O
Although O
these B-P
workers I-P
do I-P
not I-P
produce I-P
profit I-P
directly I-P
, O
what B-P
they I-P
do I-P
is I-P
for I-P
the I-P
well I-P
- I-P
being I-P
of I-P
the I-P
whole I-P
society I-P
. O
However O
, O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
citizens B-C
have I-C
other I-C
important I-C
responsibilities I-C
to I-C
fulfil I-C
apart I-C
from I-C
paying I-C
tax I-C
. O
As O
we O
know O
, O
there B-P
are I-P
impoverished I-P
or I-P
disabled I-P
people I-P
in I-P
every I-P
society I-P
, I-P
needing I-P
help I-P
and I-P
support I-P
from I-P
others I-P
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the B-P
government I-P
can I-P
provide I-P
some I-P
fund I-P
to I-P
ease I-P
their I-P
difficulties I-P
, O
but O
such B-P
financial I-P
help I-P
is I-P
usually I-P
far I-P
from I-P
enough I-P
. O
In O
such O
case O
, O
aids B-P
from I-P
more I-P
capable I-P
or I-P
wealthier I-P
citizens I-P
are I-P
particularly I-P
crucial I-P
, I-P
which I-P
are I-P
a I-P
great I-P
complement I-P
to I-P
government I-P
support I-P
. O
Another B-P
responsibility I-P
all I-P
citizens I-P
should I-P
take I-P
is I-P
to I-P
maintain I-P
social I-P
stability I-P
together I-P
with I-P
the I-P
police I-P
force I-P
. O
There B-P
are I-P
criminals I-P
in I-P
every I-P
society I-P
, I-P
and I-P
the I-P
number I-P
of I-P
policemen I-P
the I-P
government I-P
can I-P
hire I-P
is I-P
limited I-P
. O
So O
it B-P
is I-P
quite I-P
necessary I-P
for I-P
the I-P
local I-P
residents I-P
to I-P
take I-P
actions I-P
and I-P
ensure I-P
the I-P
safety I-P
of I-P
the I-P

with I-M
a I-M
secondary I-M
language I-M
as I-M
early I-M

comfortable I-C

the I-C
use I-C
of I-C

than I-C
their I-C
native I-C
tongue I-C
when I-C
they I-C

a I-P
way I-P
that I-P

well I-P

trained I-P
in I-P
the I-P
use I-P

Nevertheless O

it O
is O
undeniable O
that O
kids B-P
are I-P
amazing I-P
learners I-P
, I-P
and I-P
the I-P
best I-P
time I-P
to I-P
hone I-P
them I-P

in I-P
their I-P
younger I-P
years I-P

The B-P
introduction I-P
of I-P
foreign I-P
language I-P
will I-P
be I-P
new I-P
to I-P
them I-P
; O
however O
, O
their B-P
curiosity I-P
will I-P
drive I-P
them I-P
to I-P
learn I-P
and I-P
comprehend I-P
. O
In O
this O
way O
, O
grasping B-P
a I-P
new I-P
language I-P
will I-P
be I-P
natural I-P
to I-P
them I-P
. O
In O
addition O
, O
the B-P
positive I-P
impact I-P
of I-P
this I-P
strategy I-P
is I-P
beneficial I-P
to I-P
both I-P
learners I-P

Teachers B-P
will I-P
not I-P
find I-P
it I-P
difficult I-P

make I-P

the O
use O

each I-C
other I-C
after I-C
they I-C

There O

no O

some B-C

some B-P
people I-P

Therefore O
, O
those B-P
local I-P

have I-P
to I-P
clean I-P
the I-P
place I-P
frequently I-P
so O
that O
the B-P
new I-P
batch I-P
of I-P

will I-P
have I-P
a I-P
tidy I-P

neat I-P
environment I-P
. O
Moreover O
, O
tourists B-P

the I-M
reduction I-M
of I-M
crime I-M
rates I-M
due I-M
to I-M
the I-M
death I-M

because O
of O
many O
reasons O
. O
Firstly O
, O
capital B-P
punishment I-P
is I-P
a I-P
form I-P
of I-P
revenge I-P
which I-P
creates I-P
violent I-P
culture I-P
. O
Crimes B-P
kill I-P
someone I-P
which I-P
is I-P
illegal I-P
; I-P
nevertheless I-P
, I-P
the I-P
government I-P
use I-P
law I-P
to I-P
punish I-P
them I-P
, I-P
which I-P
is I-P
the I-P
same I-P
way I-P
they I-P
sinned I-P
but I-P
in I-P
a I-P
legal I-P
one I-P
. O
As O
a O
fact O
that O
the B-P
criminal I-P
is I-P
repeated I-P
second I-P
time I-P
; O
also O
, O
it B-P
is I-P
regarded I-P
as I-P
the I-P
" I-P
legalized I-P
revenge I-P
" I-P
to I-P
victims I-P
' I-P
family I-P
. O
Hence O
, O
death B-C
penalty I-C
neither I-C
controls I-C
the I-C
violent I-C
in I-C
society I-C
nor I-C
creates I-C
a I-C
violent I-C
culture I-C
. O
Secondly O
, O
nobody B-C
has I-C
the I-C
right I-C
to I-C
take I-C
another I-C
human I-C
life I-C
. O
It O
is O
undeniable O
that O
the B-P
rights I-P
of I-P
life I-P
are I-P
the I-P
basic I-P
and I-P
vital I-P
rights I-P
of I-P
a I-P
human I-P
being I-P
. O
No B-P
one I-P
has I-P
the I-P
right I-P
to I-P
take I-P
the I-P
life I-P
of I-P
a I-P
human I-P
; I-P
even I-P
if I-P
he I-P
committed I-P
murder I-P
. O
If B-P
you I-P
kill I-P
a I-P
criminal I-P
, I-P
you I-P
become I-P
a I-P
criminal I-P
. O
Moreover O
, O
if B-P
we I-P
think I-P
that I-P
killing I-P
is I-P
the I-P
best I-P
way I-P
to I-P
solve I-P
the I-P
problem I-P
, I-P
it I-P
is I-P
neither I-P
unethical I-P
nor I-P
immoral I-P
. O
In O
short O
, O
crimes B-P
seem I-P
to I-P
increase I-P
due I-P
to I-P
the I-P
capital I-P
punishment I-P
. O
Finally O
, O
with B-C
some I-C
of I-C
serious I-C
criminals I-C
, I-C
capital I-C
punishment I-C
is I-C
an I-C
easy I-C
way I-C
out I-C
. O
Criminals B-P
should I-P
be I-P
punished I-P
for I-P
their I-P
misdeeds I-P
. O
If B-P
they I-P
kill I-P
someone I-P
and I-P
end I-P
their I-P
life I-P
by I-P
dead I-P
without I-P
paying I-P
for I-P
their I-P
sins I-P

it I-P
is I-P
so I-P

them I-P

They B-P
do I-P
not I-P
undergo I-P
any I-P
pain I-P
or I-P
misery I-P

Why O
do O
not O
we O

some B-P

many I-P

Why B-P
do I-P
not I-P

them I-P
by I-P
doing I-P
something I-P
meaningful I-P
for I-P
the I-P
country I-P

it I-P

a I-P
better I-P
way I-P
in I-P
order I-P

prevent I-P
or I-P
minimize I-P
offensive I-P
acts I-P
. O
To O
conclude O
, O
capital B-P
punishment I-P
is I-P
a I-P
form I-P
of I-P
legalized I-P
revenge I-P
, I-P
it I-P
is I-P
an I-P
easy I-P
way I-P

, I-P
and I-P
nobody I-P
has I-P
rights I-P

the B-M

To O
start O
with O

since O

student I-C
have I-C
been I-C
exposed I-C
to I-C
a I-C
wide I-C
range I-C
of I-C
information I-C

which I-C
neccessarily I-C
broaden I-C
their I-C
minds I-C
. O
The B-P
internet I-P
, I-P
for I-P
example I-P
, I-P
provide I-P
knowledge I-P
in I-P
the I-P
form I-P

reseachs I-P

any I-P
particular I-P
fields I-P

There B-P
, I-P
the I-P
students I-P
can I-P
not I-P
only I-P
ascertain I-P

they I-P
can I-P
also I-P
get I-P
access I-P
to I-P
relevant I-P

and I-P
discuss I-P
with I-P
people I-P
worldwide I-P
. O
Another B-C
point I-C
that I-C
students I-C
may I-C
benefit I-C
from I-C
technology I-C
is I-C
the I-C
shortened I-C

The B-P
modern I-P

tend O
to O
dedicate O
large O
amounts O
of O
airtime O
and O
space O
to O
detailed O
reports O
about O
crimes O
. O
Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
such B-M
details I-M
should I-M
be I-M
strictly I-M
censored I-M
, I-M
if I-M
not I-M
banned I-M
altogether I-M
. O
It O
is O
widely O
known O
that O
the B-P
press I-P
provide I-P
the I-P
public I-P
with I-P
criminal I-P
content I-P
in I-P
order I-P
to I-P
increase I-P
newspaper I-P
circulation I-P
and I-P
TV I-P
rating I-P
. O
These B-P
days I-P
the I-P
primary I-P
purpose I-P
of I-P
journalists I-P
covering I-P
the I-P
details I-P
of I-P
criminal I-P
acts I-P
is I-P
, I-P
more I-P
often I-P
than I-P
that I-P
, I-P
to I-P
boost I-P
newspaper I-P
circulations I-P
and I-P
TV I-P
ratings I-P
. O
Consequently O
, O
a B-C
great I-C
deal I-C
of I-C
crime I-C
coverage I-C
is I-C
rather I-C
biased I-C
, I-C
exaggerated I-C
or I-C
fraudulent I-C
, I-C
which I-C
only I-C
result I-C
to I-C
terrorize I-C
communities I-C
and I-C
leave I-C
law I-C
- I-C
aiding I-C
people I-C
increasingly I-C
apprehensive I-C
of I-C
about I-C
crimes I-C
. O
An O
even O
more O
detrimental O
fact O
is O
that O
detailed B-P
reports I-P
of I-P
crimes I-P
exposured I-P
on I-P
the I-P
press I-P
may I-P
provide I-P
the I-P
potential I-P
criminals I-P
with I-P
instructive I-P
learning I-P
materials I-P
, I-P
which I-P
would I-P
be I-P
hard I-P
to I-P
obtain I-P
otherwise I-P
. O
This B-P
may I-P
help I-P
those I-P
who I-P
are I-P
in I-P
the I-P
process I-P
of I-P
panning I-P
a I-P
criminal I-P
act I-P
perfect I-P
their I-P
plans I-P
, I-P
avoid I-P
the I-P
pitfalls I-P
and I-P
make I-P
themselves I-P
harder I-P
to I-P
be I-P
tracked I-P
down I-P
by I-P
the I-P
police I-P
. O
Thus O
, O
without B-C
the I-C
prevention I-C
on I-C
criminal I-C
details I-C
, I-C
the I-C
unlawful I-C
behavior I-C
would I-C
be I-C
more I-C
and I-C
more I-C
severe I-C
and I-C
the I-C
social I-C
harmony I-C
would I-C
be I-C
broken I-C
. O
Most O
importantly O
, O
particular B-C
coverage I-C
of I-C
heinous I-C
crimes I-C
may I-C
further I-C
traumatize I-C
the I-C
victims I-C
of I-C
crimes I-C
because O
they B-P
have I-P
already I-P
suffered I-P
greatly I-P
for I-P
what I-P
they I-P
have I-P
experienced I-P
. O
Without B-P
their I-P
consent I-P
, I-P
this I-P
could I-P
only I-P
add I-P
to I-P
theses I-P
innocent I-P
people I-P
' I-P
s I-P
mental I-P
suffering I-P
and I-P
they I-P
may I-P
do I-P
some I-P
extreme I-P
actions I-P
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
strongly O
hold O
my O
point O
that O
any B-M
descriptions I-M
of I-M
crimes I-M
should I-M
not I-M
go I-M
unchecked I-M
as I-M
any I-M
longer I-M
, O
as B-C
they I-C
may I-C
be I-C
false I-C
, I-C
may I-C
further I-C
drive I-C
up I-C
the I-C
already I-C
- I-C
high I-C
crime I-C
rate I-C
and I-C
may I-C
bring I-C
even I-C
more I-C

the I-C
victims I-C

Personally O
, O
I O

in I-P
many I-P
cases I-P

For O

there B-P

male I-P
scientists I-P

a I-P

Besides O
, O

likely I-P
to I-P
prefer I-P
some I-P
jobs I-P

communication I-P
, I-P
such I-P
as I-P

This O
means O
that O

differ I-P

in I-P
mind I-P

behaviour I-P
to I-P
a I-P
large I-P

both I-P

better I-P

in I-P
the I-P

Furthermore O
, O
it B-C
can I-C
have I-C
a I-C
negative I-C

these I-C

a B-P

is I-P
arranged I-P

an I-P
engineering I-P
department I-P
, O
but O
she B-P
is I-P
unlikely I-P
to I-P
focus I-P
on I-P
her I-P
subject I-P
, O
and O
this B-P
also I-P
can I-P
block I-P
the I-P

future I-P
development I-P
and I-P
career I-P
prospect I-P
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
universities B-C
should I-C
encourage I-C
more I-C
girls I-C
to I-C
choose I-C
science I-C
subjects I-C
and I-C
more I-C
boys I-C
to I-C
study I-C
the I-C
humanities I-C
, O
and O
this B-P
could I-P
avoid I-P
imbalance I-P
of I-P
gender I-P
in I-P
some I-P
subjects I-P
. O
It B-P
would I-P
affect I-P
students I-P
' I-P
mental I-P
health I-P
to I-P
study I-P
in I-P
the I-P
environment I-P
of I-P
single I-P
gender I-P
. O
In O
conclusion O
, O
it B-M
is I-M
necessary I-M
for I-M
universities I-M
to I-M
respect I-M
the I-M
individual I-M
choice I-M
