Take B-P

both I-C

I O
will O

some O
basic O
reasons O
as O
following O
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Firstly O
, O
extra B-P
income I-P
that I-P

By B-P
taking I-P
up I-P

a I-P

more I-P
money I-P

This B-P
is I-P
really I-P
necessary I-P
in I-P
cases I-P
of I-P
her I-P
husband I-P
' I-P
s I-P
low I-P
salary I-P
and I-P
the I-P
difficulty I-P
of I-P
getting I-P
a I-P
good I-P
job I-P
at I-P
the I-P
present I-P
. O
So O
, O
it B-C
is I-C
a I-C
normal I-C
practice I-C
for I-C
women I-C
to I-C
be I-C
helpmates I-C
in I-C
earning I-C
money I-C
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Secondly O
, O
working B-P
outside I-P
the I-P
house I-P
creates I-P
opportunities I-P
for I-P
married I-P
women I-P
to I-P
contact I-P
with I-P
the I-P
outer I-P
world I-P
, I-P
strengthen I-P
their I-P
character I-P
and I-P
show I-P
their I-P
capacity I-P
. O
These B-P
things I-P
in I-P
turn I-P
will I-P
make I-P
them I-P
more I-P
confident I-P
, I-P
independent I-P

These B-P
women I-P
will I-P
set I-P
a I-P
good I-P
example I-P

their I-P
children I-P

Therefore O
, O
it B-C
is I-C
no I-C
doubt I-C
that I-C
they I-C
play I-C
roles I-C

a I-C

exhaust I-P

disease I-P

Therefore O
, O
it B-C
is I-C
crucial I-C
to I-C
alter I-C
automobiles I-C
to I-C
the I-C
other I-C
means I-C
of I-C

and I-C

Secondly O
, O
an B-P
increase I-P
in I-P
the I-P
number I-P

automobiles I-P
causes I-P

traffic I-P
congestion I-P
. O
Once B-P
we I-P
get I-P
into I-P
the I-P
traffic I-P
jam I-P
, I-P
it I-P
forces I-P
us I-P

our I-P

. O
What O
is O
worse O

traffic B-P
congestion I-P
irritates I-P

a I-P
result I-P

it I-P
leads I-P

an I-P
increase I-P
of I-P

accidents I-P

Thus O
, O
the B-C
methods I-C
to I-C
reduce I-C
the I-C
number I-C
of I-C
automobiles I-C
and I-C
to I-C
control I-C
car I-C
ownership I-C
and I-C
use I-C

In O
order O

solve O
these O
problems O
, O
alternative B-C
forms I-C

transportation I-C
and I-C
international I-C
laws I-C
to I-C
control I-C
automobiles I-C
ownership I-C
and I-C
use I-C
can I-C
work I-C
effectively I-C
. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
former O
, O
alternative B-P
forms I-P
which I-P
emit I-P
less I-P
carbon I-P
dioxides I-P
and I-P
gasses I-P
than I-P
automobiles I-P
are I-P
ideal I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
rental B-P
bicycle I-P
system I-P
has I-P
been I-P
introduced I-P
in I-P
several I-P
European I-P
countries I-P

This B-P
system I-P
is I-P
that I-P
at I-P
the I-P
corner I-P
of I-P
each I-P
district I-P
, I-P
the I-P
rental I-P

are I-P

the I-P

can I-P
ride I-P
it I-P
to I-P
the I-P
other I-P

with I-P
a I-P
small I-P

Since O

However O
, O
gun O

some O

relatively O
loose O

others O

Therefore O
, O
this O
is O
still O
a O
controversial O
topic O
around O
the O
world O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O

it B-M

The O
first O
factor O
considered O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
accidents O
with O

The B-P
accidents I-P
cannot I-P
be I-P
completely I-P
avoided I-P
although I-P
only I-P
those I-P
who I-P
have I-P
gun I-P
licenses I-P
can I-P
purchase I-P

For O

we B-P
hear I-P
some I-P
news I-P

that I-P
someone I-P
was I-P
hurt I-P

So O
the B-C
fewer I-C

the I-C
fewer I-C

would I-C
happened I-C

most B-C
violent I-C
crimes I-C
are I-C
related I-C

the I-C
abuse I-C

in I-C
some I-C
countries I-C

guns I-C

available I-C

society I-P

Take O
an O
example O
, O
in B-P
American I-P

young I-P
adults I-P

even I-P
juveniles I-P
can I-P
get I-P
access I-P

which I-P
leads I-P
to I-P
the I-P
tragedies I-P
of I-P
school I-P
gun I-P
shooting I-P

What O
is O
worse O
, O
some B-P
terrorists I-P
are I-P
able I-P
to I-P
possess I-P
more I-P
advanced I-P
weapons I-P
than I-P
the I-P

which I-P
makes I-P
citizens I-P

danger I-P
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Thirdly O
, O
the B-C
possession I-C

also I-C
raise I-C
the I-C

suicide I-C

In B-P
the I-P
US I-P
, I-P

the I-P
most I-P

method I-P
of I-P

, I-P
accounting I-P
for I-P
about I-P
50 I-P

Unfortunately O

there B-P
is I-P

the B-P
major I-P

the I-P

Secondly O

the B-C
sources I-C

use I-P

solar I-P

the O

way O
, O
the B-P

as I-P
an I-P
alternative I-P

the I-P
hydro I-P

kinetic I-P

government I-M
to I-M

use I-C

I O

sport B-P

that I-P

these I-C

there B-C

some I-C

Although O

there B-P

usually I-P
difficult I-P

by I-P
thieves I-P
, I-P
the I-P

they I-P

Thus O

it O

who I-P
have I-P
no I-P

Thus O
, O
exposing B-P
them I-P
to I-P
the I-P
past I-P

the I-P

can I-P

I O

reasons O

-DOCSTART- -X-
The O
main O
reason O
why O
I O
believe O

be O

is O
because O
art B-P

the I-P
quality I-P

our I-P

For O
example O
, O
monuments B-P
that I-P

In O
fact O
, O
some B-P

depend I-P

as I-P
their I-P
main I-P
source I-P
of I-P
revenue I-P
, O
thus O
, O
the B-C
governments I-C
should I-C
help I-C
arts I-C
because O
their B-P
work I-P
crafts I-P
are I-P
very I-P
necessary I-P

generally I-P
reflect I-P
the I-P
culture I-P

every I-P
generation I-P

Therefore O
, O
culture B-C

can I-C

reason O
why O

this B-P

also I-C
the I-C

this O

-DOCSTART- -X-
The O
first O
and O
foremost O
reason O
lies O
in O
an O
inevitable O
fact O
that O
the B-P
more I-P
advanced I-P
facilities I-P
we I-P
have I-P
, I-P
the I-P
more I-P
chances I-P
we I-P

increase I-P
our I-P

example O
, O
library B-P

a I-P
good I-P
place I-P
for I-P

study I-P

They B-P

also I-P
, I-P
there I-P
are I-P
a I-P

students I-P

utilize I-P
. O
With B-P
this I-P
convenient I-P
and I-P
versatile I-P
facility I-P
, I-P
students I-P
can I-P
improve I-P
their I-P
learning I-P
condition I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
can O
commence O
to O
agree O
that O
certain B-C
facilities I-C
are I-C
beneficial I-C
to I-C
students I-C
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Moreover O
, O
another O
equally O
crucial O
aspect O
is O
that O
students B-P
are I-P
not I-P
always I-P
staying I-P
in I-P
classrooms I-P
. O
They B-P
have I-P
numerous I-P
activities I-P
in I-P
school I-P
. O
Consider B-P
a I-P
circumstance I-P
in I-P
which I-P
a I-P
student I-P
who I-P
is I-P
a I-P
member I-P
of I-P
jazz I-P
ensemble I-P
in I-P
their I-P
school I-P

He B-P
must I-P
need I-P
a I-P
better I-P
auditorium I-P

him I-P
to I-P
have I-P
an I-P
extraordinary I-P
performance I-P

With B-P
this I-P
distinguished I-P
performance I-P

the I-P
student I-P
would I-P
acquire I-P
an I-P
unforgettable I-P

valuable I-P
experience I-P

deeply I-P
in I-P
his I-P

this O
case O

My O
arguments O
for O
this O
point O
are O
listed O
follows O
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Firstly O
, O
training B-P
time I-P
can I-P
provide I-P
employee I-P
interesting I-P
time I-P
outside I-P
working I-P
office I-P
to I-P
refresh I-P
their I-P
mind I-P
. O
Clearly O
, O
in B-P
company I-P
we I-P
always I-P
have I-P
to I-P
deal I-P
with I-P
so I-P
many I-P
stressful I-P
situations I-P
such I-P
as I-P
negotiating I-P
with I-P
difficult I-P
customer I-P
, I-P
complaining I-P
from I-P
boss I-P
, I-P
etc I-P
. O
Therefore O
, O
we B-C
can I-C
unleash I-C
uncomfortable I-C
in I-C
training I-C
classes I-C
by I-C
making I-C
new I-C
friends I-C
, I-C
joking I-C
in I-C
class I-C
, I-C
enjoying I-C
new I-C
knowledge I-C
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Secondly O
, O
employees B-C
fell I-C
that I-C
they I-C
are I-C
valuable I-C
if I-C
they I-C
are I-C
trained I-C
. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
the B-P
employees I-P
know I-P
that I-P
their I-P
company I-P
is I-P
investing I-P
on I-P
them I-P
for I-P
future I-P
development I-P
of I-P
their I-P
company I-P
. O
So O
obviously O
, O
they B-P
will I-P
think I-P
about I-P
develop I-P
long I-P
term I-P
career I-P
with I-P
their I-P
company I-P
. O
For O
another O
thing O
, O
employees B-P
will I-P
be I-P
very I-P
proud I-P
of I-P
themselves I-P
when I-P
they I-P
are I-P
provided I-P

Thirdly O
, O
providing B-C
training I-C
will I-C
make I-C
employees I-C
happy I-C

job I-C
because O
it B-P
help I-P
them I-P
improve I-P
their I-P
professional I-P
business I-P
knowledge I-P
. O
Having B-P
professional I-P
training I-P
help I-P
employees I-P
gain I-P
more I-P
confidence I-P
in I-P
their I-P
business I-P
, O
so O
I O
believe O
that O
they B-P
will I-P
finish I-P
their I-P
jobs I-P
with I-P
excellent I-P
result I-P
. O
Of O
course O
, O
excellent B-P
working I-P

will I-P

In O
conclusion O
, O
providing B-C
professional I-C
training I-C
as I-C
a I-C
reward I-C
for I-C
good I-C
work I-C
has I-C
many I-C
advantages I-C
. O
Training B-P
can I-P
help I-P
employees I-P

Taking O

these O

we O

the O

the O

sometimes B-C
the I-C
students I-C

the I-P

I B-P

a I-P

learned I-P
quickly I-P

understood I-P
everything I-P

Thus O
, O
she B-P

Secondly O
, O
students O

In O
my O
experience O
, O
many B-P
times I-P
I I-P
did I-P
not I-P

because I-P
my I-P
university I-P

not I-P

the I-P

some B-C

Firstly O

the B-P
first I-P
advantage I-P
of I-P
living I-P

a I-P

is I-P
a I-P
healthy I-P
life I-P
that I-P

One B-P
of I-P
the I-P
conditions I-P
that I-P

such I-P

a I-P

of I-P
the I-P
main I-P
consequences I-P
is I-P

Moreover O

in B-P
a I-P

Regardless O

living I-C

healthier I-C

Secondly O

another B-C
advantage I-C

one I-P
of I-P

, O
I B-M

I O
think O
it B-C

some I-C
advantages I-C

the O

the B-C

a B-P

more I-P

with I-P
other I-P

so O
their B-C

have I-C
more I-C
time I-C
to I-C
teach I-C
him I-C

children B-C

mirror I-C
themselves I-C

their I-C

even B-P

First O

, O
I O
truly O
believe O

opportunity I-C

Another O

since O

them I-P
thoroughly I-P

after I-P
that I-P

a I-P

the I-P
points I-P

In B-P
this I-P
way I-P

not I-P
only I-P

The O
first O
important O
point O
that O
I O

to O
make O
is O
that O
sociologists B-P
found I-P
that I-P
our I-P

even I-P
though I-P
when I-P
we I-P

So O
it B-C
is I-C
crucial I-C
to I-C

our I-C
children I-C
as I-C

as I-C
possible I-C

my O
point O
I O

a O
memory O

my O
childhood O
, O
when B-P
I I-P
was I-P
at I-P
age I-P

my I-P

I I-P
liked I-P

I I-P
spend I-P

whole I-P

I B-P
asked I-P
my I-P
father I-P

extra I-P
money I-P
, I-P
but I-P
he I-P
refuse I-P
to I-P
give I-P
it I-P
to I-P
me I-P
. O
I B-P
found I-P
that I-P
I I-P
should I-P
manage I-P
the I-P
way I-P
that I-P
I I-P
spend I-P
money I-P

-DOCSTART- -X-
Firstly O
, O
The O
distinguishing O
fact O
of O
the O
learning B-C
with I-C
a I-C
teacher I-C
is I-C
that I-C
you I-C
can I-C
ask I-C
about I-C
problems I-C
related I-C
your I-C
studies I-C
. O
In O
other O
words O
, O
when B-P
we I-P
encounter I-P
difficulty I-P
in I-P
our I-P
study I-P
which I-P
we I-P
can I-P
not I-P
make I-P
out I-P
, I-P
that I-P
asking I-P
the I-P
difficulty I-P
from I-P
our I-P
teacher I-P
is I-P
propitious I-P
way I-P
for I-P
us I-P
to I-P
solve I-P
it I-P
instantly I-P
. O
In O
addition O
, O
professors B-P
and I-P
teachers I-P
have I-P
much I-P
experience I-P
and I-P
knowledge I-P
, I-P
and I-P
are I-P
so I-P
dextrous I-P
with I-P
letting I-P
students I-P
understand I-P
their I-P
study I-P
. O
They B-P
know I-P
something I-P

not I-P

communicate I-P
with I-P
my I-P

a I-P

answer I-P

my I-P

Secondly O
, O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
the B-C
learning I-C
with I-C
a I-C

is I-C
more I-C
efficient I-C
than I-C
by I-C
myself I-C

We B-P
can I-P
accomplish I-P
our I-P
assignments I-P
with I-P
little I-P
help I-P
of I-P
a I-P
teacher I-P
within I-P
less I-P
time I-P

do I-P
it I-P
by I-P
ourself I-P

Furthermore O
, O
the B-P
teachers I-P
play I-P
important I-P
role I-P
in I-P
leading I-P
us I-P
to I-P
right I-P
direction I-P

, O
This B-P
gives I-P
us I-P
opportunity I-P

rise I-P
our I-P
educational I-P
level I-P
to I-P
an I-P

Finally O
, O
of O

, O
being B-C
without I-C

has I-C
shortcomings I-C

Notable O
one O
of O
the O
shortcomings O
is O
that O
if B-P
someone I-P
faced I-P
so I-P
complicated I-P
confusion I-P
in I-P
his I-P

and I-P
his I-P
many I-P
endeavors I-P
on I-P
making I-P
out I-P
it I-P
were I-P
miscarried I-P
, I-P
this I-P
might I-P
be I-P
ended I-P
in I-P
disappointment I-P

I O
think O
that O
for B-P
one I-P
who I-P
depends I-P
on I-P
only I-P
himself I-P
in I-P
learning I-P

his I-P

out O
the O

the O

follows O
. O
-DOCSTART- -X-
Firstly O
, O
the B-C
students I-C
are I-C
not I-C
constantly I-C
expert I-C
in I-C
every I-C
part I-C
of I-C
a I-C

. O
For O
example O
, O
I O
love O
Physics O
. O
But O
I B-P
don I-P
' I-P
t I-P
like I-P
electronics I-P
, O
because O
electronics B-P
cannot I-P
always I-P
be I-P
seen I-P
in I-P
the I-P
real I-P
world I-P
. O
And B-P
I I-P
have I-P
had I-P
0 I-P
in I-P
physics I-P
score I-P
when I-P
I I-P
study I-P
the I-P
electronics I-P
. O
But B-P
I I-P
constantly I-P
achieve I-P
100 I-P
score I-P
when I-P
I I-P
study I-P
other I-P
part I-P
of I-P
the I-P
physics I-P
. O
And B-P
if I-P
I I-P
cannot I-P
attend I-P
the I-P
classes I-P
until I-P
I I-P
pass I-P
the I-P
exam I-P
of I-P
electronics I-P
, I-P
I I-P
could I-P
not I-P
pass I-P
the I-P
entire I-P
part I-P

and I-P
I I-P
will I-P
fail I-P
the I-P

over I-P
and I-P
over I-P
again I-P
. O
Luckily B-P
, I-P
in I-P
our I-P
university I-P
, I-P
you I-P
can I-P
attend I-P
the I-P
classes I-P
regardless I-P
of I-P
the I-P
score I-P
you I-P
reach I-P
. O
And B-P
I I-P
can I-P
study I-P
physics I-P
without I-P
consideration I-P
of I-P
my I-P
electronics I-P
. O
And B-P
at I-P
last I-P
, I-P
I I-P
took I-P
the I-P
electronics I-P
again I-P
and I-P
pass I-P
the I-P

-DOCSTART- -X-
Secondly O
, O
if B-C
the I-C
university I-C
take I-C
the I-C
policy I-C
that I-C
no I-C
one I-C
can I-C
attend I-C
the I-C
classes I-C
without I-C
passing I-C
exam I-C
, I-C
students I-C
are I-C
highly I-C
likely I-C
to I-C
leave I-C

. O
If B-P
one I-P
fail I-P
most I-P
of I-P
the I-P
exam I-P
, I-P
it I-P
means I-P
that I-P
he I-P
or I-P
she I-P
cannot I-P
participate I-P
in I-P
most I-P
of I-P
the I-P

And B-P
the I-P
students I-P
will I-P
have I-P
nothing I-P

do I-P
in I-P
the I-P

Then O
he B-P
or I-P
she I-P

The B-P
academic I-P
achievement I-P

In O
the O
end O
, O
this B-P
student I-P
will I-P
become I-P
a I-P

in I-P
the I-P

And B-P
all I-P
this I-P
is I-P
due I-P
to I-P
that I-P

This B-P

not I-P
the I-P

no I-C

whether I-C

the B-P

To O

the B-C

I O
think O
the B-P
most I-P

way I-P

improve I-P
the I-P

to I-P
guide I-P

By B-P
renewing I-P
some I-P

more I-P
time I-P
at I-P

. O
A B-P
comfortable I-P
environment I-P
can I-P
attract I-P

Thus O
, O
students B-P
spend I-P
more I-P

make I-P
a I-P
good I-P

To O

I O

my I-P

after I-P

Thus O
it O
is O
very O
obvious O
that O
using B-C

matter I-M
how I-M
widely I-M

There O
are O
several O
reasons O
why O
saving B-C
regional I-C
languages I-C
could I-C
be I-C
seen I-C
as I-C
a I-C
waste I-C
of I-C
money I-C
. O
Firstly O
, O
we B-P
need I-P
to I-P
consider I-P
that I-P
if I-P
the I-P
government I-P
expands I-P
the I-P
use I-P
scope I-P
of I-P
that I-P
languages I-P
, I-P
it I-P
can I-P
be I-P
really I-P
expensive I-P
because O
educational B-P
programmes I-P
will I-P
need I-P

given I-P
so I-P
as I-P
to I-P
keep I-P
young I-P
people I-P
learning I-P

using I-P
them I-P
. O
For O
example O
, O
some B-P
certain I-P
areas I-P
in I-P
the I-P
Southern I-P
Vietnam I-P
have I-P
been I-P
trying I-P

their I-P
secondary I-P

are I-P
originally I-P
from I-P
khmer I-P
people I-P
speak I-P
their I-P
language I-P
beside I-P
Vietnamese I-P
, O
so O
the B-P
local I-P
government I-P
has I-P
recently I-P
struggled I-P
with I-P
their I-P
costly I-P
investments I-P
on I-P
language I-P

, I-P

appropriate I-P

Secondly O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
in B-C
many I-C

such I-C
as I-C

as I-C

it I-C
will I-C
be I-C
absolutely I-C
easier I-C
for I-C
the I-C
whole I-C
society I-C

Despite O
of O
the O
above O
arguments O
, O
i O
still O
strongly O
believe O
that O
the B-C
government I-C
should I-C
try I-C
to I-C
preserve I-C
minority I-C
languages I-C
. O
This O
is O
because O
language B-P
can I-P
be I-P
seen I-P
as I-P
much I-P
more I-P
than I-P
just I-P
one I-P
method I-P
of I-P
communication I-P
. O
In O
addition O
, O
forming B-P
a I-P
language I-P
must I-P
be I-P
undergone I-P
thousands I-P
of I-P
years I-P
; O
thus O
, O
it B-P
deserves I-P
to I-P
be I-P
respected I-P

preserved I-P
. O
Last O
but O
not O

, O
language B-P
is I-P
one I-P
of I-P
the I-P
essential I-P
factors I-P
creating I-P
the I-P
differences I-P

unique I-P
cutures I-P

Therefore O
, O
saving B-P
the I-P
use I-P
of I-P
that I-P
kinds I-P
of I-P

in I-P
this I-P

conclusion O

although O
letting B-C
